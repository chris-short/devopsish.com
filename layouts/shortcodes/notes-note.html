<p>Every week I comb through 1000s of articles that get curated down to about 100 URLs eligible to be in <a href="https://devopsish.com">DevOps'ish</a>. Those URLs land in a notes file that end up being source material for the newsletter. Being in that group of ~100 links is an achievement and should be lauded.</p>

<p>It's a shame when I have to choose between having too many links or someone's special thing getting featured in the newsletter. Here's another chance to shine! As always, thank you for reading! â€”Chris Short</p>
