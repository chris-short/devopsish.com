<p>Every week I comb through 1000s of articles that get curated down to somewhere between 60 to 100 URLs eligible for <a href="https://devopsish.com/" title="DevOps'ish: DevOps, Cloud Native, Hybrid Cloud, Open Source, industry news, and the â€˜ish between.">DevOps'ish</a>. Those URLs land in this notes file that ends up being source material for the newsletter. Being in that group of links is an achievement of its own and should be lauded.</p>

<p>It's a shame when I have to choose between having too many links or someone's special thing getting featured in the newsletter. Here's another chance to shine!</p>

<p>As always, thank you for reading,<br />
