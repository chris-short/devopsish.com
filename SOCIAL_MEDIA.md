# Minimum Viable Social Media

In my experience running this newsletter, it will get stickier subscribers through social media than ads. Below are the latest iteration of social media messaging that seems to land well enough to keep the newsletter growing.

If someone with a larger social media presence shares any of these social media posts, expect 100 quality subscribers (on average). Doing the same with advertising dollars often means a lot of short term subscribers and wasted money.
