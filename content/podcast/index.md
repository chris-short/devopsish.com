We will go over the inputs into the newsletter (not necessarily the newsletter itself) to give listeners a different look at the news that complements the newsletter. The DevOps'ish Podcast is recorded via [Twitter Spaces](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces) and audience participation is highly encouraged (follow [@ChrisShort](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort) on Twitter).
