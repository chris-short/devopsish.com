I started the DevOps'ish newsletter in 2016 with hopes of lowerering the barrier to entry into the DevOps and Cloud Native world while keeping seasoned professionals informed on the latest news, tools, and trends. Every now and then I hear from readers who have turned into fans. It's a great motivator for what can be a thankless job at times. Here are some of their remarks, because sometimes it's important to toot your own horn.

[!["Even on vacation, I sneak in a couple newsletters. My fave link in the latest DevOps'ish (besides the ASODR survey ‘natch) is the one about open office spaces." —Nicole Forsgren][nicolefv]](https://twitter.com/nicolefv/status/1113069829001568256)

[!["I read this NL every week @ChrisShort gathers an amazing collection of tech #OpenSource #DevOps news. Worth a read and a subscription!" —Kim McMahon][kamcmahon]](https://twitter.com/kamcmahon/status/1085654763193098240)

[!["I don't read a lot of tech newsletters, but there are 3 that I do, for various reasons! Devops'ish by @ChrisShort puts so much good stuff there, that I must confess that I usually just scan the previous week's top 5, very convenient." —Jérôme Petazzoni][jpetazzo]](https://twitter.com/jpetazzo/status/1129916987545653248)
