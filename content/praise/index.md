I started the DevOps'ish newsletter in 2016 with hopes of lowering the barrier to entry into the DevOps and Cloud Native world while keeping seasoned professionals informed on the latest news, tools, and trends. Every now and then I hear from readers who have turned into fans. It's a great motivator for what can be a thankless job at times. Here are some of their remarks, because sometimes it's important to toot your own horn.

## Quotes

"If you want to get the lowdown on all things DevOps, you could do a lot worse than Chris Short. He boasts outstanding credentials – he's a CNCF ambassador, has experience with Red Hat and Ansible – but more importantly is the quality of his insights.

A great place to begin is with [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com), a newsletter Short produces, which features some really valuable discussions on the biggest issues and talking points in the field."
