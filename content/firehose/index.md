If you've ever read DevOps'ish or saw Suggested Reads from me on social media, [this](https://raindrop.io/ChrisShort/dev-ops-ish-firehose-15805349) is where they are all saved.

Since social media platforms are getting very flaky (Twitter, Reddit, etc.), I'll share the news feed here in case I leave whatever social media site you followed me on. There is also an [**RSS** feed](https://bg.raindrop.io/rss/public/15805349).
