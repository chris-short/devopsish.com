If you've ever read DevOps'ish or saw Suggested Reads from me on social media, this is where they are all saved. New links shared to [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/ChrisShort/dev-ops-ish-firehose-15805349) would get baked into the newsletter every week. Not only that, new links meant the automation to send them out via social media was triggered as well.

Since the newsletter is no more and social media platforms are getting very flaky, I'll share the news feed here in case I leave whatever social media site you followed me on. [The **RSS** feed](https://bg.raindrop.io/rss/public/15805349) is also available.
