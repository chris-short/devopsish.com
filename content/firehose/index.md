If you've ever read DevOps'ish or saw links I've shared on social media, [this](https://raindrop.io/ChrisShort/dev-ops-ish-firehose-15805349) is where they are all saved. This is also the feed for the [**DevOps'ish subreddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/).

Since social media platforms are becoming increasingly unstable (Twitter, Reddit, etc.), I'll share the news feed here in case I leave a particular social media site you follow me on. There is also an [**RSS** feed](https://bg.raindrop.io/rss/public/15805349).
