## Ad Format

Your ad will be featured *natively* in e-mails to all subscribers and on [devopsish.com](https://devopsish.com/).

Ads include a bolded headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, *SPONSORED*. This native format prevents ad blockers from blocking ads. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting. Total ad copy length excluding headline, call to action, and *SPONSORED* tag should not exceed 280 characters. Think of ads in DevOps'ish as a tweet with a bolded headline on top.

### Example Ad

[**DEVOPS NEWSLETTER**](https://devopsish.com/)  
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam ut libero erat. Morbi convallis tempor facilisis. In vulputate hendrerit mollis. Suspendisse vitae massa aliquet, dignissim nibh quis, facilisis odio. Fusce sed consequat magna. [Join Today!](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/) *SPONSORED*

#### Ad Placement

Ads usually appear in the section they make the most sense at the time of writing or after the introduction to the newsletter itself. If a specific location in the newsletter suits your ad, then it can be placed there.

DevOps'ish does not host sponsored content at this time. But, in true DevOps form, there's always room for new ideas.

## Get Started

Feel free to ask any questions you may have. The process is pretty painless once we're agreed to an ad spot. PayPal is used for invoicing and payments. The ads start when specified and run continuously through the ad period. I highly recommend longer term sponsors update ad copy routinely.
