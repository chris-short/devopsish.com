## DevOps'ish Ad Format

Your ad will be featured *natively* in e-mails to all subcribers and on [devopsish.com](https://devopsish.com/). At special request, I can share your ad on social media. However, a limit exists of no more than three shares per week on a schedule that fits the needs of advertiser(s).

Ads include a bolded headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, *SPONSORED*. This native format prevents ad blockers from blocking ads. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting. Total ad length excluding headline, call to action, and *SPONSORED* tag should not exceed 280 characters.

Every week the newsletter begins with an introduction. Ads appear after this message. If another location in the newsletter fits better for your ad please let me know.

### Example Ad
