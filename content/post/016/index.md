If Nicole Forsgren can bust out 38 awesome people DevOps'ing surely you can come up with ten. Share your ten awesome folks of #DevOps with [me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort). Nicole also started a "Ladies in [#DevOps](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevOps?src=hash)" trend in the process of sharing this list. Show people respect where it is due.

## Department of Choice Concepts

[Jacob Hoffman-Andrews was on The Changelog recently discussing Let's Encrypt](https://changelog.com/podcast/243). It is a fairly journey through the birth of one of the most important projects of the last couple of years.

[Containerization Leaders Explore Possible Standardized Data Storage Interface](https://thenewstack.io/containerization-leaders-explore-possible-data-storage-interface-initiative)

## Department of Data Defense

A utility company made a horrific mistake this week by letting a lesser experienced IT staffer represent their brand. Their page was not encrypted (HTTPS) so Mozilla was showing their page as insecure. The staffer filed a [bug report with Mozilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1348902) (which is now locked). The IT staffer went so far as to claim the company ["has never been breached in more than 15 years."](https://twitter.com/konklone/status/843933144789213186) [Within minutes of this bug report hitting The Register](https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/843935688814862336) the [company's site](http://www.oilandgasinternational.com/) was hacked and has been offline since.

[A number of NTP vulnerabilities were announced this week](http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#March_2017_ntp_4_2_8p10_NTP_Secu). These vulns definitely affect Red Hat products. Red Hat has yet to release a patch.

[LastPass had a very rough week](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/03/21/lastpass_vulnerabilities/). I wanted to leave LastPass after their [acquisition by LogMeIn](https://chrisshort.net/lastpass-sells-out-to-logmein/). However, there was not a sufficient replacement then. There are now several feature rich password managers on the market. Our household has migrated off LastPass with extreme prejudice.

[Google is dropping Symantec on its head by de-trusting its Certificate Authority](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/eUAKwjihhBs/rpxMXjZHCQAJ).

## Department of Next Year's Old Tech

[cURL is NINETEEN years old](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/03/20/19-years-ago/)!

## Department of Sane Workplaces

[GitHub now lets its workers keep the IP when they use company resources for personal projects](https://qz.com/937038/github-now-lets-its-workers-keep-the-ip-when-they-use-company-resources-for-personal-projects/?s=1). This headline might be the most underrated event of the week.

[Open floor plans suck](https://codewithoutrules.com/2017/03/20/open-floor-plan/). Can we just go ahead and come up with something between open and rows of offices? [Open floor plans are detrimental to those that live in more cognitive roles](https://qz.com/938169/introverts-are-the-secret-weapons-of-the-modern-office/).
