It's weird how things decay online. A 404 here, a failed git submodule update there can lead to weird things breaking. I noticed that happening with [chrisshort.net](https://chrisshort.net/). The site had gotten slower too despite it being a static site served through Cloudflare. I spent an evening looking for new [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) themes. Testing their performance, figuring out what design would work best for me, and  looked pleasant.

Last night, I ended up picking [the updated version of the theme I was already using](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/beautifulhugo/). Today, I tuned it for a balance of features and performance. Then I went about tweaking the features to my liking. After cleaning up some 404s, I promoted the branch to master, and the CI was off and running.

At what point was I doing web development? I don't know. But, that's how I got my second big job in tech. Internet Explorer (back when it was on a coveted CD) came with [FrontPage Express](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage). Say what you want about FrontPage. But, I knew how to use Microsoft Word and FrontPage Express gave me a WYSIWYG that showed me how to write HTML at the flip of a switch. Then I started writing web sites to W3C specs, discovered CSS, and ended up writing more web sites in Notepad then later [jed](https://www.jedsoft.org/jed/) and [vim](https://www.vim.org/).

I was a senior in high school and needed a job after work. It was a fortuitous event that I needed internet access and they needed me. I took what I learned in my first tech job as an MIS technician and what I learned about Web 1.0 on my own and turned it into one of the best jobs I ever had. I learned about enterprise IT, Windows, and Linux. I read RFCs, ran internet services and loved my massive desk with two customized computers. One computer ran Windows 98 (seldom used) and my daily driver ran [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux). The best part was the full T-1 speed late at night.

Then the dot-com bubble burst and off to the Air Force I went. Where I did do some upgrading of Air Combat Command's websites. At no point though did I consider myself a web developer but, maybe that should change. I've done it longer than I've done DevOps. Ha! Who am I kidding? This is hard stuff and I'd rather leave it up to the experts. **Web development is hard**. Fight me.
