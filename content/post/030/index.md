Summer in Michigan is pretty interesting. Every lake with houses near it seems to have a fireworks display. There's been fireworks displays since Monday. My poor dog, Sunny, is terrified of fireworks so this weekend we're holing up in the basement. She's heard a few pops today and is happily down here beside me snoozing.

The world of **DevOps** is running full bore. Microsoft is making big moves. Kubernetes marches forward. Let's Encrypt crossed a major milestone. Ubuntu is being shady. The NSA, Intel, and Verizon are all being naughty. Oh... And Detroit is still awesome. [You should consider working with me](http://app.jobvite.com/m?3ru8KiwA). Let's get to this week's DevOps news!

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) has another great drawing about [Linux tracing systems & how they fit together](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/881003937750544384).

Mathias Lafeldt shows why [Embracing Failure in a Container World](https://medium.com/production-ready/embracing-failure-in-a-container-world-217a3cc414c1) is a good thing. I also like this method of presenting slides from a talk.

## Department of Discussion

Let's Encrypt has reached a major milestone having now [issued 100 million certificates](https://letsencrypt.org//2017/06/28/hundred-million-certs.html).

The Kubernetes Bench for Security is a Go application that checks whether Kubernetes is deployed according to security best practices.

[The NSA's hacking tools have been used in yet another global attack: Petya](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraines-government-key-infrastructure-hit-in-massive-cyberattack/2017/06/27/7d22c7dc-5b40-11e7-9fc6-c7ef4bc58d13_story.html)

The [Open Security Controller](https://www.opensecuritycontroller.org/about/) (OSC) project was formed to centralize security services orchestration for multi-cloud environments.

## Department of Dafuq

Canonical is injecting [ads in Ubuntu's motd](https://twitter.com/astarrb/status/880170781841514496)? Not really says [Dustin Kirkland, the developer](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/base-files/+bug/1701068/comments/11).

[Google Cloud Storage was an "answer" on Jeopardy](https://twitter.com/nealmueller/status/880505739655077888) and no one got it! What the hell?!?!

[[WARNING] Intel Skylake/Kaby Lake processors: broken hyper-threading](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2017/06/msg00308.html)

## Department of Sane Workplaces

Pivotal lost a key pickup while Microsoft is proving how serious it is about open source. [Ashley McNamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara), Go Developer and all around amazing person, has [left Pivotal to join Microsoft](https://medium.com/@ashleymcnamara/the-best-career-advice-ive-received-so-far-is-never-turn-down-an-interview-7586ca5b7ef8). Microsoft is now a place I would, without a doubt, work. If they can convince Ashley they've changed then I'm certain they truly have. Ten years ago and even five years ago I never would have worked at Microsoft.
