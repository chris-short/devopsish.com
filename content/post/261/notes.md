**Editor's note**: I cannot ignore Putin's war being waged in Europe. But, this newsletter is a tech newsletter. However, as I've discovered I cannot unlearn my previous life's skills. I have been thanked for providing another perspective to coverage of the war in Ukraine. One person's politics, is another person's life. All the [Ukraine news](#ukraine) is moving to the [UkraineNoCap](https://twitter.com/ukrainenocap) Twitter account.
