A few themes to this week's news are worth discussing here in the newsletter's introduction to give folks a clearer picture of each topic. We'll tackle them in the same People, Process, and Tools format DevOps'ish uses (which are the three core components of DevOps, in order of importance). Surprisingly, I have to explain the Tools section of the news the most because it involves one of the world's most toxic companies, **Docker**.

I want to take this moment to remind folks about this site's [disclaimer](https://devopsish.com/terms#disclaimer).

## Google's firing of Timnit Gebru

Google continues to display lousy behavior towards people who highlight what it's doing wrong, potentially to the detriment of the entire planet. Google fired Timnit Gebru for an email (which isn't unheard of), but it's a fact she found flaws in large language models, which are a big part of Google's operating model could hurt people. The concern is around the staggering impact on the environment and economics of large language models.

Building these models takes a significant amount of compute costing somewhere between $942,973-$3,201,722 and dumping 626,155 pounds (284,019 kilograms) of carbon into the environment. There's also a [Standing with Dr. Timnit Gebru](https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382) page that I've signed, and I'd encourage you to do so as well (if it safe for you to do so without risk of retaliation).

The most comprehensive coverage of Timnit Gebru's firing is from MIT Technology Review's, [*We read the paper that forced Timnit Gebru out of Google. Here’s what it says.*](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/)

The actual email Timnit Gebru sent that got her fired is available via [Platformer News](https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical). It delves into the current climate at Google and how it's not living up to its expectations. The truth hurts so much it'll get you fired at Google.

## Slack acquired by Salesforce

All your SaaS are belong to Salesforce. At least that's their goal it seems. The world was thinking this could be bigger than the IBM-Red Hat acquisition. It almost did, [clocking in $27.7 Billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/technology/salesforce-slack-deal.html). But, why did Slack want to be acquired? According to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22150313/how-microsoft-crushed-slack-salesforce-acquisition), Slack grew to 12 million users, while since 2016, Microsoft Teams grew to 115 million thanks to its free inclusion in Office365. The acquisition will position Slack to better compete with Microsoft Teams but, this is a fine example of Microsoft's monopoly building skills of the 1990s in full effect.

## dockergate (again) 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

From the [Kubernetes 1.20 changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.20.md):

> ### Deprecation
> > Docker support in the kubelet is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. The kubelet uses a module called "dockershim" which implements CRI support for Docker and it has seen maintenance issues in the Kubernetes community. We encourage you to evaluate moving to a container runtime that is a full-fledged implementation of CRI (v1alpha1 or v1 compliant) as they become available. ([#94624](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94624), [@dims](https://github.com/dims)) [SIG Node]

Mirantis and Docker don't have their eye on Kubernetes. I think we can infer that from this week's debacle. That became apparent this week when [Ian Coldwater noted the dockershim deprecation](https://twitter.com/iancoldwater/status/1334161889476157442) was coming in Kubernetes 1.20. In early October, a [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) was created to remove dockershim from kubelet](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/1985-remove-dockershim) (because either a shim turns into something maintainable or it goes away).

For most people, [this shouldn't be a huge deal](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/). But the entire team of people it took, led by Kat Cosgrove, to explain how the technologies folks were using work deserve a huge thank you. They all took on the monumental task of informing run of the mill Docker users that what they are working on is [legacy tooling](https://twitter.com/mlbiam/status/1335238217168203776) at best.

This usually isn't a big deal, but Docker has built a toxic community full of people who think they know better. I knew this from [my 2017 article, where I declared Docker dead](https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/). Ian and Kat sadly experienced this first hand. Ian raised the alarm in the CNCF Ambassadors channel that they could use some help. This is where I screwed up. Sitting on the Kubernetes Upstream Marketing team, I should have alerted our crew immediately. But, in all fairness, this shouldn't have been necessary.

[We all make assumptions about how things work. It's a proven fact (I strongly encourage you to read more on this topic from Dr. Richard I. Cook).](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3380777) When someone shows us differences in our assumptions, we should assume that we're in for a learning experience. Never should we mount up for a fight, which is what a lot of Docker users did. That and being creepy or derogatory toward the people trying to explain the aforementioned KEP. On a medium not designed to have deep, technical conversations.

Item nine on the [Cloud Native Trail Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cncf/trailmap/master/CNCF_TrailMap_latest.pdf) are Container Registry and Runtime. You can run any [OCI compliant](https://opencontainers.org/) container runtime thanks to the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI) in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/). The CNCF landscape is rather [specific about what container runtimes work with Kubernetes](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=container-runtime&format=card-mode&grouping=category). Containerd, donated to CNCF by Docker years ago, is sort of the default as it's the only graduated runtime out there. Docker was hard to work with back in their heyday (still is apparently), so Red Hat created and donated CRI-O to CNCF, a lightweight alternative to Docker, which like containerd is based on [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) from OCI. But, all these runtimes offer something that the other doesn't. CRI-O answered Docker's bloated implementations (Docker is more than one thing, and they have a considerable naming problem). Containerd is the OCI compliant runtime that Docker officially switched over to a while back. But, you could still run [docker-engine runtimes](http://petty.company/products/container-runtime) in Kubernetes.

But, dockershim is on its way out of the kubelet. What should you do? Investigate what runtimes are in use in your environment and make the switch to an OCI compliant runtime. Trust but verify, folks.

Allow me to elaborate on the "Mirantis and Docker don't have their eye on Kubernetes" point. The deprecation of dockershim has been a long time in the making. The KEP, which is an enormous amount of information to assemble and has many artifacts as a part of it, was published on 2020-10-06. A full two months ago. That's when Mirantis and Docker should've done something. But, no, it took this massive Twitter shit storm, an [FAQ](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dockershim-faq/), and a [blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) from the Kubernetes team before Mirantis ([the legacy company in Marc Boorshtein's example](https://twitter.com/mlbiam/status/1335238217168203776)) did anything to address this issue.

Mirantis did so in [a blog post stating they'd continue support for dockershim](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/mirantis-to-take-over-support-of-kubernetes-dockershim-2/) and details on how to keep it as a runtime in Kubernetes would be coming. Who knows if Mirantis even looked at the code and all the reasons for its deprecation before they made this promise. But, they did it anyway because their business appears to be helping legacy workloads trod on. Regardless, [plans remain unchanged to remove support for dockershim from kubelet](https://twitter.com/dims/status/1335262856187695105). CRI is still moving towards production readiness in Kubernetes and docker-engine is still incompatible with CRI.

**I've mentioned this before, but getting off Docker should be a strategic imperative in your organization.** You must remove this [technical debt](https://twitter.com/chumboslice/status/1335576919434293248) sooner rather than later. To quote fellow CNCF Ambassador [Kat Cosgrove](https://twitter.com/Dixie3Flatline/), who took on the nearly impossible task of explaining this change to folks, "Docker is no more than a user experience at this point." *Note: Do not harass Kat or you'll be biting off way more than you can chew.*

Alternative tools have come a long way since the advent of Docker. Consider those before continuing to march forward with what is all but legacy software. You'll be better for it. Remember, something can die in tech without a replacement. It's not always competition or time that ends a business or technology. They often implode under their own weight.

Still curious what this all means in more technical terms, check fellow CNCF Ambassador Gianluca Arbezzano's blog: [Kubernetes v1.20 the docker deprecation dilemma in practice](https://gianarb.it/blog/kubernetes-1-20-dockershim-in-practice).
