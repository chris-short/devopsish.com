I want to point out a few signs that I think we're pushing the industry too hard, too fast. [Fires in AWS data centers](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1403100781646028808), [Fastly (the CDN) took an hour-long outage](https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/08/numerous-popular-websites-are-facing-an-outage/) triggered by a [customer finding a bug](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jun/09/fastly-says-single-customer-triggered-bug-that-caused-mass-outage), [Cloudflare had outages in Chicago and Los Angeles](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/0cvlzpvwg251). [Ransomware is running through companies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/08/ransomware-human-impact/) like Grant went through Richmond (to the point the [US Justice department is equating them, in some ways, to terrorist attacks](https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-03/ransomware-targeted-by-justice-department-as-attacks-flourish)).

Things need to change. Moving towards a more hybrid and fluid environment is not just a strategic priority; it's survival at this point. Then making sure that your entire business can't grind to a halt because lowest common denominator security issues happen. I thought we figured it out in the early 2000s. But, technology has changed so much since then, and there are new zero-days every day. We're in a very tight position as technologists. If you're a developer, you're a target. If you're an employee, you're a target. You and every service you touch is a target. Nothing is safe.

Yeah... This has gotten out of control.

"The system pieces together the ultrasonic information that's all around us to identify when its services are needed, and sense what's going on around it. Researchers have demonstrated that it can identify household and office activities with greater than 95% accuracy."

[FBI sold phones to organized crime and read 27 million "encrypted" messages](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/fbi-sold-phones-to-organized-crime-and-read-27-million-encrypted-messages/)  
"But instead of getting backdoors installed into commonly used productsâ€”a step that Apple and other companies resisted because it would undermine security for all usersâ€”the FBI simply made and sold encrypted devices and monitored the devices' communications." If the intelligence community wants you, it'll find a way.

BOHICA! But, long overdue.

Observability is critical for managing and improving complex business-critical systems. With observability, any software engineering team can gain a deeper understanding of system performance, so you can perform ongoing maintenance and ship the features your customers need. Preview [Honeycomb's upcoming O'Reilly book](https://info.honeycomb.io/observability-engineering-oreilly-book-preview-0?&utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ad&utm_content=devopsish&utm_adgroup), written by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda, to understand the value of observable systems and how to build an observability-driven development practice. *SPONSORED*

[How Hackers Used Slack to Break into EA Games](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kvkqb/how-ea-games-was-hacked-slack)  
"the process started by purchasing stolen cookies being sold online for $10 and using those to gain access to a Slack channel used by EA. Cookies can save the login details of particular users, and potentially let hackers log into services as that person. In this case, the hackers were able to get into EA's Slack using the stolen cookie." Then it was social engineering the IT team at EA and off they went with valid 2FA and all.

[ALPACA Attack](https://alpaca-attack.com/)  
"ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard certificates. Attackers can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session."
