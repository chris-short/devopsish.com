At 8:13 PM last Saturday, the family and I were gathered in our basement, evading a tornado warning that came through the area. The storm spawned three tornadoes. Luckily, we weren't hit directly. But we lost power, internet, and cell service. After getting the all-clear and assessing the situation, it was clear that we would be without power for quite a few hours. Making a newsletter last week wasn't happening. It was technically impossible, and to be honest, I had a big ole stack of higher priorities come in. Then a few hours turned into a few days without these services. Luckily, we have a gas stove and water heater.

I spent Monday morning frantically trying to find a place with the trifecta of power, internet, and cell service. It didn't exist within a twenty-minute radius of our house. We spent over 44 hours without power. We were lucky we didn't have to wait much longer than that. The roof that I thought was damaged wasn't (the shingles in our yard weren't ours üò¨üò¨üò¨). Cell service came back up in the morning on Tuesday.

The fragility of our millions of dollars in infrastructure became very apparent Saturday night as we watched our world turn suddenly dark with little warning. I'm more used to hurricanes (typhoons) where you know days in advance to be ready. The suddenness of it all is what sucked. We got a relatively typical warning of potential severe weather (a 50/50 shot of something happening). It wasn't until after Max was in bed that things got bad. Getting through it all takes calm and patience. But that's hard to say to the five-year-old.

As always, I treated the whole thing as a learning and preparation exercise for the next storm. Julie got [an updated battery pack](https://amzn.to/3xr4GCZ). We also got a [solar panel charging station](https://amzn.to/3iddNmg) and a [solar and hand-cranked powered emergency radio](https://amzn.to/3j7JufW) with many bells and whistles. When I made coffee using a mortise and pestle as a grinder, I realized I needed to get a [hand-cranked coffee grinder](https://amzn.to/3ihOZJC) (It's a solid five-minute workout, according to my Apple Watch). Also, I'm not going to lie; this [neck fan](https://amzn.to/3C1eNlh) might be one of the greatest inventions ever (especially in humid weather).

My wife said the weekend felt like three weeks on Tuesday while I nodded in vigorous agreement. It made this week chaotic and more challenging to manage than usual. I am lucky I had a well-trained intern and a supportive team around me.
