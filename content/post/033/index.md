Sunday, I flew back to NC to help close and move out of our house. It has turned into quite the saga that I won't bother with trying to explain to everyone. But, having injections on moving day was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. The world of [**DevOps**](https://devopsish.com/) was quite busy this week. Also, several great [talks from GopherCon are available in various forms](https://github.com/gophercon/2017-talks), including my GopherCon 2017 Lightning Talk: [Golang to the rescue: Saving DevOps from TLS turmoil](https://chrisshort.net/testing-certificate-chains-in-go/). Last, but not least, [happy second birthday, Kubernetes!](https://twitter.com/hashtag/K8sBday?src=hash)

And, I want to celebrate it by sharing my Kubernetes journey with you. My disclaimer is this is a very personal post, and that's always a vulnerable thing to do.

[Microsoft is Hiring Go engineers to work on Kubernetes](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/6o2lc3/microsoft_is_hiring_go_engineers_to_work_on/): We're looking for Go engineers to work on Kubernetes and related cloud/distributed systems.

[Life Is About to Get a Whole Lot Harder for Websites Without HTTPS](https://www.troyhunt.com/life-is-about-to-get-harder-for-websites-without-https/): Here's an important observation on all this: at present, we know secure pages are secure because the browser tells us so.

It's the principle of being insecure by default and that's what we're increasingly moving away from.

There's hardly any excuse for this and it indicates that they operate a certificate authority without a proper understanding of the cryptographic background.
