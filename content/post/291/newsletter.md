**Side Note:** I have no doubt that Twitter is going to unban people that really shouldn't be for national security reasons. With that in mind, I've consolidated my Mastodon presence on the Mastodon server [hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/invite/52R3N6to) so please follow me there [@ChrisShort](https://hachyderm.io/invite/52R3N6to)!

**Also**, Happy birthday, Max! My youngest's birthday is today. Stay awesome, buddy!

Let me be abundantly clear. I had a great KubeCon. It was rough physically, though, as I'll explain. [Seeing Ihor come on stage was the inspiration I needed](https://twitter.com/linuxfoundation/status/1585308260780756992) FOR SURE. It was a negative in my "keynotes from the hotel room strategy," though. I am truly sad I couldn't say hello to more people and help folks more. Please [DM me on the platform of your choosing](https://chrisshort.me/). Let's get you booked into the podcast schedule or a Zoom or phone call.

Every KubeCon, I tell myself, "Take Wednesday completely off, and you'll make it through the whole thing." Every time, I fail. This past Wednesday wound up being the busiest day. I also over-extend myself to do more during KubeCon than anyone else could; *this habit dies now*.

It was apparent that I'd bit off more than I could chew when [I said I was bringing video gear](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1583434676105986050) this time. I got so many responses there was no way I was going to get everyone or even have time to get some process together. I needed a process to manage the deluge of responses. I ended up saying, "I'll follow up next week." [The DevOps'ish Podcast](https://devopsish.com/podcast/) could use y'alls voices.

I did notice this year, in particular, that Tuesday was relatively tranquil. Tuesday may be the key to my survival. I am at a point where I mentally and physically need a break to make it Sunday through Friday. As I said on Justin Garrison's pre-KubeCon Twitter Space, "KubeCon is the equivalent to our Super Bowl." Folks who work in the Kubernetes space prep all year for two events. Other folks at more prominent companies likely have their events to prep for as well. AWS employees get [re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/) after KubeCon (which adds another more substantial than-Super Bowl-like event). Two Super Bowls and Super Bowl++ a year can challenge anyone.

As promised, Max and I went downtown on Saturday. Due to logistics and timing, we didn't meet with anyone, so it was an excellent Max and Daddy outing. He rather enjoyed the Van Gogh exhibit at the [Detroit Institute of Arts](https://dia.org/). We found a print of the Detroit skyline with a Van Gogh-style *Starry Night* sky.

I spent Sunday frantically packing while taking care of Max. Julie was at a volleyball open house. My egress from the house was less than optimal due to tight windows around meeting people, badge pick-up, and family events. I only managed to forget one thing: my iPad Pro. A total mistake. The iPad Pro was going to be my computer for the trip, so I spent the first few days dragging my roller laptop bag around (I need a four-wheel version, which is what KubeCon Detroit showed me). As my friend, [the illustrious Langdon White](https://twitter.com/1angdon) pointed out, Detroit has more enormous potholes than Boston. There's also a lot of road construction to fix that. But I had Buddy's and Prime and Proper that day, which was an outstanding experience with my boss and some friends.

Monday was the Kubernetes Contributor Summit. It was a little spicy to start. I'm not looking up stats, but this felt like the lightest year of my open source contributing of late. We've lost a lot of contributors due to folks' shifting priorities during the pandemic. There is an acknowledgment from Kubernetes Steering that things must change. I feel our processes need simplification, onboarding programs need active owners, and we must commit to only what we can for our health. Regardless, it felt terrific seeing my friends and fellow contributors in Detroit. I had a busy but good Kubernetes Contributor Summit.

Tuesday was light. I cleared my schedule so I could get some work done while recuperating. I went to the AWS Partner reception and talked with a few folks. Then I retired for the evening to do light physical therapy before bed.

Icing the tennis elbow and heating the shoulder in the AM and PM plus massage gun usage was a HUGE part of my "get through KubeCon" strategy. It takes a minimum of 30 minutes, I have to do it at certain intervals, and it will give me a very valid reason to head back to the hotel in the 9 PM hour at the latest.

Wednesday started with a great start. I got to ride around and get interviewed by the, as mentioned earlier, Langdon White in a Ford Mustang Mach-E (the [pictures are worth it](https://twitter.com/chrisshort/status/1585260802784698368)) for [Kube by Example](https://twitter.com/kubebyexample/status/1586047752118886400). Then I met up with Aeva Black to discuss our [upcoming The New Stack segment](https://twitter.com/thenewstack/status/1585294030757236737). That went wonderfully and focused on how SBOMs, as they are, are not actionable enough. I can't wait to see those outputs. Then I did some hanging around the booth and hallway track. I went to a session about reforming the CNCF Ambassador program. I'm happy with how that meeting went and the changes that will make the program more open, effective, and hopefully more successful.

Excellent stuff, right?!? Here's where the unplanned event derailed the rest of the conference much more than I imagined it could. It was a little before 4 PM, and I had a gap before the [Slim.ai](https://www.slim.ai/) dinner. I decided to return to the hotel, lidocaine, ice, heat, and catch up on the news for this week's newsletter. I ended up being locked away from all my medications, therapy tools, and a comfy place to sit for two hours. The battery in my door lock decided it needed a nap. By the time I got in, ice, heat, pain meds, and everything else, it was almost 8 PM. At that point, I had minimal feeling in my hand. I knew I would struggle with sleep and the arm the next day. I ended up going to bed.

This trip was by far the weirdest Marriott experience I've had. The location was practical but also had its quirks. Thursday, I woke up to no in-room coffee and an arm that was not working efficiently and needed to be iced ASAP. I asked them to send up some in-room coffee. First, they sent up a cup of coffee. Twenty minutes later, a bag of coffee for the week was delivered (brilliant). But, I never had my room serviced after Monday morning (due to staffing shortages).

I did everything possible to make myself right, which worked, but it took a lot of time. I went to ADHD: Understanding, Awareness, And Shared Experience - Bart Farrell, Data on Kubernetes Community; Heba elAyoty, Microsoft; Farrah Campbell, Amazon Web Services; Rich Burroughs, Loft Labs. It was one of those talks where every hand goes up in the room when it opens up for questions. It was a fantastic talk, and you should watch it. Videos are already showing up on [CNCF YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn).

I had a wonderful lunch with a container space CTO. I did more booth stop-ins, networking, and my toy runs for Max from the show floor (having done the [CNCF Store](https://store.cncf.io/) shopping on Wednesday for myself, Max, and my nephews). I have a 2XL Notary shirt that I'll ship to anyone in the lower 48 states of the US for free (DM me).

After that, things started to decline quickly physically. I have this issue on lousy pain days where meds don't last as long and fall off faster the closer I get to the time for my afternoon dose. When I realized I was hurting, I was an hour late. Another mistake didn't take me down but made things a smidge harder. I opted to have a quiet night of news reading, ice, and heat. I still bumped into people between the back way to dinner and taking it back to my room.

Friday morning, I was rough. I was hydrated, had a RxBar, and was lightly caffeinated. I decided to grab some Panera at 8:45 AM. Returning to my room, I hit my social interaction upper limit for the week as I bumped into multiple people. I set up my in-room keynote watching (MacBook Pro, [Dongle for USB, power, and HDMI](https://amzn.to/3zv8xTb), HDMI cable to hotel TV). I watched the keynotes with a special appreciation for Bob and Jeff's talk. My boss checked in; I let him know I was done. I went home and did everything I could to make myself right for Max after school. We had a lot of catching up to do. Now I need some time to relax.
