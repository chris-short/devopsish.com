**Side Note:** I have no doubt that Twitter is going to unban people that really shouldn't be for national security reasons. With that in mind, I've consolidated my Mastodon presence on the Mastodon server [hachyderm.io](https://hachyderm.io/) so please follow me there [@ChrisShort](https://hachyderm.io/@ChrisShort)!

## People

[Five hours' sleep is tipping point for bad health](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63284305?utm_source=devopsish)  
Michelle Roberts, BBC News  
This really bites you in the ass in your 50s.

[Google's Jigsaw, with U.S. government money, is bringing a VPN to Iran](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/10/13/iran-protests-google-jigsaw-vpn/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Joseph Menn and Yasmeen Abutaleb, The Washington Post  
I used Jigsaw ([Outline](https://getoutline.org/)) for quite some time. It's quite good and easy enough for non-tech saavy folks to manage.

[Equifax surveilled 1,000 remote workers, fired 24 found juggling two jobs](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/equifax-surveilled-1000-remote-workers-fired-24-found-juggling-two-jobs/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Ashley Belanger, Ars Technica  
I treat DevOps'ish like a second job. The separation of the two is very real though. I don't need to go into great detail but there are clear boundaries where one job happens and another job happens. Everything was great until the "Allow Paste" bug showed up on iPadOS. I could work from separate devices even on the road.

[Microsoft to Cut 1,000 More Jobs as Economic Conditions Bite](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-job-losses-oct-2022?utm_source=devopsish)  
Ian Evenden, Tom's Hardware  
"New dark theme for MS employees" üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ  
That's ice cold.

[Salesforce hit with layoffs and a new hiring freeze](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/salesforce-layoffs-hiring-freeze?utm_source=devopsish)  
Joe Williams, Protocol  
"That's a small fragment of Salesforce's over 73,000 workers, but large tech companies have been loathe to undergo layoffs, most likely to avoid igniting fear among investors that their growth prospects have changed."

[Stripe Takes Steps To Prune Workforce](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2022/10/20/stripe-takes-steps-to-prune-workforce/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Jeff Kauflin and Alex Konrad, Forbes  
"*Forbes* spoke to ten former and current Stripe employees for this story; all asked to remain anonymous. In interviews and in comments online, workers say Stripe‚Äôs recent moves have exacerbated a lack of ‚Äúpsychological safety‚Äù at the hard-charging private company, leaving some afraid to speak up or express dissenting opinions."

Come to the next [GitBOM meeting](https://gitbom.dev/community/#community-meetings?utm_source=devopsish) (we're renaming it soon because it's neither Git nor BOM). It's legit, y'all.

Ouch. I feel sorry for every single startup past a certain size that uses containers. Why? Because they're getting emails like these:

[What are the four Golden Signals?](https://www.gremlin.com/blog/four-golden-signals/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Andre Newman, Gremlin  
The cornerstone of metrics at scale.

[Linux, Windows and macOS Hit By New "Alchimist" Attack Framework](https://www.hackread.com/alchimist-attack-framework-linux-windows-mac/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Deeba Ahmed, HackRead  
"Alchimist is a single-file C2 framework discovered on a server hosting an active file listing on the root directory and a set of post-exploitation tools. It is implemented in Golang and implants the Insekt RAT on the compromised systems."

## Tools

[Starlink signals can be reverse-engineered to work like GPS‚Äîwhether SpaceX likes it or not](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/21/1062001/spacex-starlink-signals-reverse-engineered-gps/?utm_source=devopsish)  
Mark Harrisarchive page, MIT Technology Review  
This article sucked me in like it had Hoover written on the front of it as it went back and forth over me. Having helped maintain many a satellite link in my days, as well as being an avid GPS consumer, this was a fascinating article that made you think real hard what you could do with just the sync parts of an otherwise encrypted signal.

[Canonical releases Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu](https://ubuntu.com/blog/canonical-releases-ubuntu-22-10-kinetic-kudu?utm_source=devopsish)  
Ubuntu  
"OpenSSH in Ubuntu 22.10 is configured by default to use systemd socket activation, meaning that sshd will not be started until an incoming connection request is received. This reduces the memory footprint of Ubuntu Server on smaller devices, VMs or LXD containers." Among various and sundry things, the SSH bits are the most interesting to me.

Jeff Geerling  
"In the presentation, I gave a tour of my homelab, highlighting it's growth from a modem and 5-port switch to a full 24U rack with a petabyte of storage and multiple 10 gigabit switches!" How well Jeff does things is truly impressive.
