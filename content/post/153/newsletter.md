Are you ready for [KubeCon](https://cshort.co/kcna19)? I'm not, but I hope to be by end of day Friday. There are a number of events every night. If your calendar isn't booked and you're looking for something to do several sponsors are hosting things across San Diego. I'll be arriving Sunday midday and heading over to [Cloud Native Rejekts](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/). Monday, I'll be helping at the New Contributor Summit. Tuesday and Wednesday are going to be non-stop Kubernetes and cloud native awesomeness. Thursday things seem to slow a little. When in doubt, I'll be near the Red Hat booth or supporting my friends that are speaking. I tell my family that this is essentially our Super Bowl for the year. I hope it doesn't disappoint.

But, the event of the year we all know is [#KubeKhan](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23KubeKhan)&src=typed_query&f=live). The come as you are, judgement free gathering is back this year with a little extra oomph thanks to our friends at [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io). It's casual and will take place every night of KubeCon activities in some capacity. But, the first official night of #KubeKhan will be Monday, November, 18th at the Marriott Marquis® San Diego Marina starting around 7-ish. The [KubeCon Code of Conduct](https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/attend/code-of-conduct/) will be adhered to.

[PodCTL Co-host](https://chrisshort.net/podctl-co-host/) — This week, Brian Gracely reached out to me to cohost [PodCTL](http://podcast.podctl.com/), Red Hat's Kubernetes podcast. Knowing that Brian has the tooling and processes in place for podcast production, I didn't even hesitate to say, “Yes!” [We recorded an episode](http://podcast.podctl.com/110399/2024361-the-intersection-of-devops-and-kubernetes)  during the calm before the KubeCon storm. [A fancy mic for my iPhone](https://amzn.to/2NYe0t0) is now part of my kit and we're off to the races.
