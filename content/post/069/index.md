What a big week for tech news! On Monday, the first Kubernetes release of 2018  dropped like the world's hottest mixtape; [Kubernetes 1.10](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/03/26/kubernetes-1.10-stabilizing-storage-security-networking/) is out! On Wednesday, we saw what I believe to be the next step in Docker's death; Solomon Hykes is out! More on that below. We also witnessed yet [another big-time company get hit by WannaCry](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-hit-by-wannacry-virus-fears-it-could-cripple-some-jet-production/); Boeing. Boeing is the latest victim of poor IT practices as it found itself fighting the fast-spreading virus. Kudos to Boeing for getting it mitigated quickly but, this should never have happened given how old WannaCry is. Then on Thursday, 150 million of us found ourselves as a victim of yet another breach when [MyFitnessPal announced its systems had been compromised](https://www.buzzfeed.com/skbaer/myfitnesspal-under-armour-data-stolen?utm_term=.gbbPDpvGR#.bnkebagxZ). The MyFitnessPal breach compromised only superficial login data and passwords. No health or government issued data was stolen. Not to be outdone, Drupal core had a ["Highly critical" RCE vulnerability](https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2018-002). To top things off there appears to be a "skip containers, go serverless" drum beat building (more on that below).

## People

[What a Docker shocker; founder, CTO Solomon Hykes takes a hike](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/03/28/docker_shocker_solomon_hykes_take_a_hike/): Solomon Hykes officially announced he was leaving Docker after presumably being [sidelined in November](https://thenewstack.io/solomon-hykes-changes-roles-docker/).  [Cluster and application management services in Docker Cloud are shutting down on May 21](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/migration/) and [Docker Security Scanning](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/image-scan/) is shuttering on March 31st. Something is definitely happening at Docker. I still think [Docker is Dead](https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/). It smells like Docker is cleaning out the crufty or unprofitable services to make themselves riper for acquisition.
