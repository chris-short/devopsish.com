Last week I thought the 100th issue of this newsletter was going to be kinda flat. Not this week! Less than twelve hours after [DevOps'ish 099](/099/) went out, the technology world confirmed change is constant; [IBM to Buy Software Maker Red Hat for About $33 Billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-28/ibm-agrees-to-buy-software-maker-red-hat-in-34-billion-deal). I think my friend and fellow Red Hatter [Ben Cotton](https://funnelfiasco.com/) said it best, "It's clearly a huge bet for IBM. But, they seem to be committed to letting Red Hat keep doing what has made them successful for the last 25 years. Only time will tell." [If you're not in turmoil and you're at a tech company consider yourself lucky](https://chrisshort.net/one-fish-two-fish-blue-fish-sporting-new-red-hat/). I have a great job, I have projects and programs to run, y'all still want Ansible so we're still gonna work on it. I have long thought the thing I missed most about being in the Air Force was being a part of history every day. I get to do that for the second time in a lifetime. Hey, "[At least it wasn't Oracle.](https://cshort.co/not-oracle)"

I'm introducing a special feature of DevOps'ish I'm calling [**Indexes**](/categories/indexes/). An index in a book allows the reader to get information either in the book itself or sometimes elsewhere. The intention of a DevOps'ish Index is to provide an updated one-stop shop for opinion, analysis, and/or coverage of a complex topic or historical event. I'm happy to introduce the [**DevOps'ish IBM Red Hat Acquisition Index**](/ibm-red-hat-acquisition-index/).
