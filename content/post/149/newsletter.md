This week's introduction is brought to you by [Corey Quinn](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig). Send complaints Corey's way:

What's made of comfy ring-spun cotton, available in your size and shape, AND guaranteed to start a flame war with your AWS pals? The 2019 Last Week in AWS Charity T-Shirt! This year's shirts come in two flavors — one for each pronunciation of the acronym for Amazon Machine Images. Are you an Ahh-Me or an Ay-Em-Eye? Pick your preference, and wear it loud and proud!

As usual, all proceeds from these shirts go directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, which has helped increase the *survival rate of childhood cancer from 20% to over 80%*. Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing, or food.

Now you can wear your inside joke on your chest, and your heart on your sleeve all at the same time. Visit [https://snark.cloud/charityshirt](https://snark.cloud/charityshirt?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=149) to buy your shirt today!

**Editor's Note**: The Short family is on vacation. DevOps'ish 150 will likely be a beautiful picture.

## Process

[Docker Desktop asset, fiscal stress prompt acquisition buzz](https://searchitoperations.techtarget.com/news/252471956/Docker-Desktop-asset-fiscal-stress-prompt-acquisition-buzz) — "Docker still has a great opportunity to add value around Kubernetes, but it doesn't help when people are wondering about their future viability as a company," said Jay Lyman, analyst at 451 Research. "When a company shuffles execs, it's an opportune time to lay out their vision of the future, so someone else doesn't do it for them." Use an incognito window if you can't see it.
