One big piece of news from the CNCF this week was [Kubernetes graduating](https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2018/03/06/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-kubernetes-first-graduated-project/). "To move from incubation to graduate, projects must demonstrate thriving adoption, a documented, structured governance process, and a strong commitment to community success and inclusivity." One questioned I was asked by a few people was what does graduating from CNCF actually mean? I asked around because it wasn't really clear to me either when the TOC started voting on it. [Chris Aniszczyk responded](http://cshort.co/k8sgrad), "[Graduation] is meant to be a stamp from the Technical Oversight Committee and the CNCF of what is a sustainable, production ready and mature open source project (i.e., you can bet your business on it)." You can bet your business on Kubernetes. That's been safe to say for a while now. The fact the ever growing and improving CNCF is now saying it makes it damn near fact.

I'll be in Silicon Valley (Sunnyvale/Santa Clara) this week for the first time ever in my life. If you want to get together, let me know ASAP.
