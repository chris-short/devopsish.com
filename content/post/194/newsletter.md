I have been struggling to get things done this week. Truth be told, I probably should've known better than to try and get anything done. I'm admittedly not good at PTO. I usually create a list of things I'd like to accomplish during PTO. Counterintuitive, huh? Well those plans came to a crashing end Thursday morning as I took a spill down the stairs at 7:30 AM. Nothing broken, but definitely landed on some things I'd rather not (right shoulder, ribs, etc.). Pain management during the holidays is already hard enough. Add in the fact that you fell down some stairs and it completely forces you to lower your expectations of yourself. Which saddens me.

The high intensity painkillers meant I immediately gave up on anything mentally taxing (like moving off current newsletter service on to a better one). Mail is insanely hard these days (DKIM, DMARC, SPF, etc.) and making a personal newsletter happen has a very high bar to clear. Once you get it, you get it. But, the days of you being able to hit reply and have it come to me are well, in question. Right now, the functionality is dead and I kinda like it that way. I always want feedback but, typically the feedback I received was only negative. Not running with working MX records is kinda nice. My email is available on my web sites. I'm not hard to find. But, the reply button is an easy path to abuse it seems. I'll be honest in saying that my psyche, needs wins right now. Being defeated by your own carbon based shell sucks.

I'll get things righted, don't worry. It'll just take longer than it would a fully able person whose not lit on pain medications.
