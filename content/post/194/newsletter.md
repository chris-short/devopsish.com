There is usually a lot of hype surrounding Apple announcements. The recent report of Apple starting to build Macs with their own ARM-based silicon is no exception. But, there’s some meat to this hype; let me explain.

It wasn't long ago that my iPhone 8 Plus with its [A11 Bionic chip](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/13/a11-bionic-chip-geekbench-scores/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194) could leave my MacBook Air I was using as a daily driver in the dust. The ARM-based phone you're carrying around (Apple or otherwise) [probably has more computing power than the entire Apollo space program](https://theconversation.com/would-your-mobile-phone-be-powerful-enough-to-get-you-to-the-moon-115933?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194).

In 2017, I was linked up with Edward Vielmetti of [Works on ARM](https://www.worksonarm.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194) fame. I was already tinkering and building Kubernetes clusters with Raspberry Pis. Ed validated my thinking and while it's going to be quite some time before we're all running ARM chips, that day is coming. I saw ARM as a fine alternative thanks to modern languages multiarch compilers (may The Maker bless Go). But there was always a cross-compilation tax for users. But, it was a one-time task if you were smart about things.

To further prove ARM's market penetration, [Docker Hub  supported "multi-platform" images](https://devopsish.com/042/) in 2017. [Cloudflare was also benchmarking the ARM chips](https://blog.cloudflare.com/arm-takes-wing/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194) they had their hands on in 2017 against their Intel fleet. Red Hat announced an [ARM-based distro of RHEL back in 2017](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-introduces-arm-server-support-red-hat-enterprise-linux?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194) (Note: Red Hat is my employer). In June 2020, an [ARM-powered supercomupter became the fastest supercomputer in the world](https://www.zdnet.com/article/arm-and-linux-take-supercomputer-top500-crown/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194).

Yesterday, I was reading the news like I normally do (in my favorite newsreader, [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194)). I kept seeing [reports about the new M1 ARM Macs](https://steipete.com/posts/apple-silicon-m1-a-developer-perspective/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194) making their users happy. I came across one article showing a very bright future for [the next generation of ARM-based Macs (the M1X chip)](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/macbook-pro-16-inch-m1x-chip-just-leaked-and-its-game-over-for-intel?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194). It's supposedly a 12 core monster that will arrive in the 16" MacBook Pro next year. All this Apple talk is the exact opposite of what I usually discuss. But, it shows the progression of ARM over a breathtaking pace. Which led me to tweet a brief synopsis of the recent history of ARM...

{{< tweet 1332691347745202182 >}}

Yes, the servers came before the supercomputers, obviously, but I was in the middle of like three things at once. Needless to say, ARM is here. We're talking about it because Apple has the design and fabrication capacity to make it happen. But, there will be many opportunities for the ole Intel and AMD allies to make the switch to offering yet another processor architecture. Dell, HP, Asus, Acer, etc., have to show they aren't lagging behind somehow. Make no mistake, Apple has the luxury of comparing itself to itself for now and potentially for all time. But, I can guarantee Microsoft does not want to lose the ARM market completely. It's why they have an [ARM version of Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=194). Hold on tight, folks. With more ways to crack an Intel chip open seemingly springing to life every month (math done by a person who is bad at it), change is afoot (or an ARM if you’re into dad jokes).

[‘Tokenized’: Inside Black Workers’ Struggles at Coinbase](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/coinbase-cryptocurrency-black-employees.html)  
"[A]ccording to 23 current and former Coinbase employees, five of whom spoke on the record, as well as internal documents and recordings of conversations, the start-up has long struggled with its management of Black employees." Some truly repugnant behavior from Coinbase.

"[Tony] Hsieh was reported injured in a house fire on Nov. 18 while visiting family members in New London, Conn. New London Fire Chief Thomas Curcio told the Day newspaper in Connecticut that firefighters rescued a victim trapped in a waterfront house. The victim, not specifically identified as Mr. Hsieh, was flown by helicopter to the burn unit of a hospital in Bridgeport, Conn."

[Linus Torvalds would like to use an M1 Mac for Linux, but...](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-would-like-to-use-an-m1-mac-for-linux-but/)  
Speaking on the new ARM-based Macs, Linus Torvalds said, "The main problem with the M1 for me is the GPU and other devices around it, because that's likely what would hold me off using it because it wouldn't have any Linux support unless Apple opens up." He's 100% right. I remember the days when only certain GPUs would work out of the box with Linux distros. ATI (now AMD) was friendly at the time. Apple needs to open up some code so Linux is a possibility. This also helps with those pesky anti-trust subpoenas potentially heading Apple's way.

[Salesforce is in talks to buy Slack, deal could be announced next week](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/slack-shares-jump-following-report-of-possible-salesforce-acquisition.html)  
"Salesforce is in talks to acquire Slack, and a deal could be announced as soon as next week, according to a person familiar with the matter." I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. Salesforce could royally screw this up when Slack's popularity is waning. Now is as good a time as ever to sell and Salesforce is going to pay the premium Slack likely wants.
