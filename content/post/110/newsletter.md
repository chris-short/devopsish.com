+++

This week I ran an unscientific Twitter poll asking, "Has DevOps left Ops behind?" It was a question that came up during a discussion with one of my  co-workers.

{{< tweet 1082767409595977729 >}}

There will be more discussion and thought around this for sure. But, it appears the software industry has gotten ahead of the skillsets of the majority of folks in it. Think about it though. We went from containers going mainstream via Docker in 2014 to Kubernetes going mainstream in 2017. Now it's 2019 and we're talking about Istio, serverless, and eBPF. If it seems like the pace of change is accelerating, it's because it is.

In Thomas L. Friedman's [*Thank You For Being Late: An Optimist's Guide to Thriving in the Age of Accelerations*](https://amzn.to/2SSD4mr) a graph is drawn by Google X's Eric "Astro" Teller like this one here.

Friedman goes on to explain that the roles of education and government today should be to figure out how to lift the line of human adaptability to be able to keep pace with technology.

This sounds familiar... It's no surprise that we in tech have been trying to do exactly this for years in tech with things like DevOps and SRE (and many things before that). I think the fact we've created "things" (DevOps, SRE, Agile, Lean, etc.) to help us adapt to change faster shows a clear sign the technology is outpacing human capacity to adapt to it. So what do we do about it? Looks like that's the big question here.

But, no one could really do anything about it at the time.

[I'm a Red Hat Certified Specialist: Ansible Automation](https://chrisshort.net/im-a-red-hat-certified-specialist-ansible-automation/) ‚Äî I did a thing because I felt I had something to prove.

[How Tilt updates Kubernetes in Seconds, not Minutes](https://medium.com/windmill-engineering/how-tilt-updates-kubernetes-in-seconds-not-minutes-28ddffe2d79f) ‚Äî Tilt is kinda in the same vein as Skaffold. It's a high-speed Kubernetes deployment/development tool. It introduces something they've dubbed a Synclet (a sidecar) that enables easy reuse of existing pods in Kubernetes as opposed to tearing the pod down, rebuilding it, and relaunching the containers in it. Pretty cool looking (I have not kicked the tires on it).

[5 open source tools to upgrade your next Kubernetes project](https://jaxenter.com/5-kubernetes-open-source-tools-154333.html) ‚Äî Tilt, Rook, Rancher, and Fission (I'd say [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/))

[8 Productivity Tips for GitHub](https://dev.to/_darrenburns/8-productivity-tips-for-github-44kn) ‚Äî I'm starting to get better about GitHub notifications, workflows, etc. I have a confession to make, I didn't know what version control software was until 2011 and then it was svn. I was anti git until a few years ago. I know how to use git but, GitHub requires its own set of tools to manage.
