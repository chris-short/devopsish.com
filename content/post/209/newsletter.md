In a first, there are two DevOps'ish Indexes in flight right now. I did not want this day to ever happen but here we are. Solarwinds and Microsoft both have their hands full. DevOps'ish has your back. Here's all the data points for both incidents so far.

* *NEW* [DevOps'ish Microsoft Exchange Hafnium Compromise Index](/microsoft-exchange-hafnium-compromise-index/)
* [DevOps‚Äôish Solarwinds supply chain compromise Index](/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/)

What a time to be alive.

Also, DevOps'ish is 101 subscribers from officially passing the 5,000 subscribers mark. This is a critical point in a newsletter's life. I'd be very appreciative if you forwarded this to a friend, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=I%20read%20DevOps'ish%20and%20you%20should%20too.%20Subscribe%20now!%20devopsish.com/subscribe%20%23devopsish%20%23DevOps%20%23Kubernetes) about the newsletter, or posted something on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevopsish.com%2Fsubscribe%2F&title=Subscribe%2Cto%2CDevOps'ish&summary=Subcribe%2C+to%2CDevOps'ish!&source=devopsish).

"His job was to sign and submit an official form. Sign the form, he believed, and he'd risk the lives of the seven astronauts set to board the spacecraft the next morning. Refuse to sign, and he'd risk his job, his career and the good life he'd built for his wife and four children.

'And I made the smartest decision I ever made in my lifetime,' McDonald told me. 'I refused to sign it. I just thought we were taking risks we shouldn't be taking.'"

"Crayton taught Antiracism 101. Now, this coach of tech leaders is focused on building out an ecosystem based on acknowledging and revolutionizing around four guiding principles:

1. Tech is not neutral. Nor is it apolitical.
2. Intention without strategy is chaos.
3. Lack of inclusion is a risk and crisis management issue.
4. Prioritize the most vulnerable."

[Google approach to HBCUs may account for Silicon Valley's lack of Black engineers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/04/google-hbcu-recruiting/)  
"'Google allocated resources so disparagingly because of how they tiered ‚Äî and thought of ‚Äî our schools,' said former recruiter April Christina Curley, who helped lead Google‚Äôs outreach to HBCUs for six years. Curley, who is Black, said she was fired in September largely as a result of continually raising concerns about bias against HBCU students in the interview and hiring process."

[The technical interview practice gap, and how it keeps underrepresented groups out of software engineering](https://blog.interviewing.io/the-technical-interview-practice-gap-and-how-it-keeps-underrepresented-groups-out-of-software-engineering/)  
"I won‚Äôt name any specific companies here, but tech giants (many with good intentions and with marching orders to boost their diversity numbers) often do a considerable amount of outreach and pre-interview engagement with candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. This outreach is usually an info session where one engineer speaks to a virtual room of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds. The engineer tells them what to expect in technical interviews, encourages them to learn how to articulate their thought process out loud while solving a problem, and recommends resources like Cracking the Coding Interview. Some companies even go so far as to offer their underrepresented candidates a mock interview or two.

Unfortunately, for candidates who are unfamiliar with the process, neither of these interventions is nearly enough."
