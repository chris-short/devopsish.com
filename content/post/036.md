This week has been a trying week for me. I've touched almost every facet of what is important to me both personally and professionally. One kid having surgery, another kid catching a cold, moving into our new home, dealing with Veteran's Affairs, addressing long-time struggles, new talent starting at work, getting things done, threats to friends on the west coast, threats to friends in Guam, Nazis on the east coast, and I did a lot of community work. This week was great on some fronts and very challenging on others. By the time 4:30 PM on Friday rolled around I was cooked. Next week, I'll be in South Florida bringing a heavy dose of DevOps to the Sunshine State.

[Figuring out how to contribute to open source](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/08/06/contributing-to-open-source/) by Julia Evans: This post isn't about "how to find small issues in open source projects to get started with open source" — instead it's about "I have a specific change I want to make to a specific project, what will help me get that done".
