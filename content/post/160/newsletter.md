Happy Holidays to everyone celebrating this time of year. I hope that your time with family was wonderful and stress-free. I have both of my kids in the same place at the same time this weekend; I am thoroughly enjoying that. Life doesn't go how you plan it. Much like in DevOps or complex distributed systems, it's not how well you stick to the plan for life; it's how you respond to anomoloies and improve the system as a whole. I had a kid at 20. She grew up a military brat and didn't have the easiest of childhoods. But, she's in college now. She's working her ass off too. But, she's doing this so she can take knowledge from us and better herself in the long run. I know it's hard, it's not the life I dreamed for her. But, we have talked about how this will prime her for a better position in life when she graduates. We're working together as a team to learn from some hard fought lessons while allowing room for mistakes. But, the safties that I didn't have are built-in so that when errors occur their blast radius can be minimized. Raising kids andteaching young adults how to life is a whole lot like DevOps. Drive towards goals, address errors, build safeties into the system as you go, and continue to iterate on every cycle to find areas to improve. There's so many parallels between life and DevOps.
