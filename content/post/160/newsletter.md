Happy Holidays to everyone celebrating this time of year. I hope that your time with family and friends was wonderful and stress-free. I have both of my kids in the same place at the same time this weekend; I am thoroughly enjoying that. Life doesn't go how you plan it. Much like in DevOps, it's not how well you stick to the plan for life; it's how you respond to anomalies and improve the system as a whole. I had a kid at 20. She grew up a military brat and didn't have the easiest of childhoods. But, she's in college now. She's working her ass off too. But, she's doing this so she can take knowledge from us and better herself in the long run. I know it's hard; it's not the life I dreamed for her. But, we have talked about how this will prime her for a better position in life when she graduates. We're working together as a team to learn from some hard-fought lessons while allowing room for mistakes. But, the safties that I didn't have are built-in so that when errors occur, their blast radius can be minimized. Raising kids and teaching young adults how to live is a whole lot like DevOps. Drive towards goals, address errors, build safeties into the system as you go, and continue to iterate on every cycle to find areas to improve. There are so many parallels between life and DevOps.

## People

[Taking Human Performance Seriously](https://www.adaptivecapacitylabs.com/blog/2017/12/19/taking-human-performance-seriously/) — John Allspaw: "The increasing significance of our systems, the increasing potential for economic, political, and human damage when they don’t work properly, the proliferation of dependencies and associated uncertainty — all make me very worried. And, if you look at your own system and its problems, I think you will agree that we need to do more than just acknowledge this — we need to embrace it."

[The tech CEOs' year of reckoning](https://www.engadget.com/2019/12/27/the-tech-ceo-year-of-reckoning/) — A year in which we all learned startup CEOs aren't going to save us (no shit).

[The unintended consequence of US campaign against Huawei could be a global split in technology standards](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3042233/unintended-consequence-us-campaign-against-huawei-could-be-global) — I would not be surprised if there were three "internets" by the end of 2020. The US-based internet, a Chinese based one (which is well on its way), and I see a potential for a third internet from either Russia or countries with despotic regimes banding together. I say that not to pick on Russians in particular but, they are moving in that general direction.

[RuNet - Russia successfully concluded tests on its Internet infrastructure Security Affairs](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/95564/security/russia-runet-tests.html) — "Russia's government announced that it has successfully concluded a series of tests for its RuNet intranet aimed at country disconnection from the Internet."

[Research: How Women Undersell Their Work](https://hbr.org/2019/12/research-how-women-undersell-their-work) — Self-promotion is how I got to where I am. If you don't toot your own horn, no one else will. But, there are good and bad forms of self-promotion.

[Significant Changes to Accessing and Using GeoLite2 Databases](https://blog.maxmind.com/2019/12/18/significant-changes-to-accessing-and-using-geolite2-databases/) — The GeoLite2 databases are handy for operational and security applications.

[Using ML to Block BGP Hijacking](https://www.usenix.org/publications/login/winter2019/camp) — "Bongo uses the Routing Information Base (RIB) to identify changes not in routes but in AS, and then assigns each AS a risk parameter. Based on this parameter, Bongo can create a firewall rule. Alternatively, Bongo may simply issue an alert to the operator, if the change is worthy of note but not high risk." This is the ML I'm here for.

[The Linux Kernel as a Case Study on Rapid Development for Complex Software](https://thenewstack.io/the-linux-kernel-as-a-case-study-on-rapid-development-for-complex-software/) — "The Linux kernel is a massive project that requires rapid development from many developers and development teams.
