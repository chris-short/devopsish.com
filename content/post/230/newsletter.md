Another week another bout of bad weather. Systems here in our home have gotten a bit more robust since our multi-day total blackout. I took a meeting this week in a house with no power. The meeting was short, but it demonstrated that if everything goes to hell in a handbasket, my systems are redundant enough to enable me to pass whatever batons when needed. But, lately, it‚Äôs felt like a lot.

You can feel the cost of communication when a cacophony of UPSes suddenly fills the house. Luckily power was restored before we went to bed that night. But, what came later was something of a surprise. In 36 hours, [Michigan received almost a quarter of its annual total of lightning stikes](https://www.mlive.com/whitecaps/2021/08/you-wont-believe-how-many-lightning-strikes-occurred-over-michigan-on-wednesday-and-thursday.html) (a lot of them cloud to ground). While this didn‚Äôt seem to affect services we consume, I can only imagine the hell it played out for multiple fire responders of all stripes.

One of the worse incidents I was part of was a lightning strike that hit a datacenter‚Äôs generator transfer switch. It kicked off a chaotic series of events that caused HVAC systems to go offline. The storm that night was hellacious too. A datacenter can generate enough heat to make network switches act up is a miserable series of events. There was no single root cause. Multiple systems failed or malfunctioned in unplanned or thought of ways. The fact we weren‚Äôt up and running once temperatures started to cool down unlocked a new mystery that ultimately led us to restart our core switches because the heat had thrown the ASICs out of whack. But, there was never a single root cause. You could say the lightning strike was the root cause. But, that hit systems outside the datacenter and related to power. Our systems went down because core switching had overheated. Cooling units inside the datacenter reset but didn‚Äôt start using refrigerant until they were reset again in a particular order (the cooling system was never supposed to respond the way it did). There‚Äôs never a single root cause for a large-scale outage (John Allspaw argues the point further below).

But, there was never a single root cause. You could say the lightning strike was the root cause. But, that hit systems outside the datacenter and related to power. Our systems went down because core switching had overheated. Cooling units inside the datacenter reset but didn‚Äôt actually start using refrigerant until they were reset again in a certain order (the cooling system was never supposed to respond the way it did). There‚Äôs never a single root cause for a large scale outage (John Allspaw argues the point further below).

Large-scale systems (and some not-so-large ones) are too complex for us to understand completely. We make assumptions past a certain threshold of knowledge. We have to start being more diligent about our assumptions and developing a better understanding of how our systems perform. We need to apply those lessons to reduce wasteful spending, protect our systems, and improve the quality of our services.

Apple is trying to keep its employees from taking surveys on pay equity. But it's illegal. What makes it worse is that Apple is thumping its chest that it doesn't have a pay inequity problem. They shouldn't with a $2.46 trillion dollar market cap and only ~147,000 employees.

[This is why Valve is switching from Debian to Arch for Steam Deck's Linux OS](https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-why-valve-is-switching-from-debian-to-arch-for-steam-decks-linux-os/)  
It always fascinates me when a project, like Steam Deck, chooses a Linux distro. Choosing Arch allows for Steam to make more iterative updates quickly. Including kernel changes. Which would be a pain to do on Debian without some kind of forking. The thing that gets me is that I fully intend to own a Steam Deck. I also plan to use it as a desktop computer as well. I wonder how consumers will use this device and how Steam will handle supporting it.

Everyone knows I'm a big ARM fan. ARM dominating the mobile phone market is just the beginning. Cheaper but performant, compute that allows for savings to get passed on to the buyer is hard to pass up. If you're smart, you'll commit to being able to run new services on ARM very soon. Then figure out how to get the rest of your codebase ported over the next two years should be a top priority. You'll be light years ahead when some amazing chips start shipping. Note: This has to go better than your switch to IPv6.
