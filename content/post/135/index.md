+++

I was on PTO this week. I was working on a number side project issues I've been trying to resolve for quite some time. This includes soft launching a podcast! [**Deep Cuts**](https://devopsish.com/deep-cuts-134/) is a podcast that looks at the news behind the news. Things that were significant but didn’t make the newsletter for one reason or another. Prepare to embrace People, Process, and Tools in your ear holes.

I say soft launch because it's important to me to take things iteratively. [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/devopsish) is the platform for the moment. They're working the difficult task of getting the podcast listed in all the major directories. Iterative improvements will be the name of the game. Feedback on anything I do is always appreciated.

Despite getting rewarded repeatedly with promotions, compensation, recognition, and praise, I wasn’t motivated enough to do another year."

[When Passion Leads to Burnout](https://hbr.org/2019/07/when-passion-leads-to-burnout) — "When we equate work we love with 'not really working,' it propagates a belief that if we love it so much, we should do more of it — all of the time, actually."

[Intro to containers, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift (DO180)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/do180-introduction-containers-kubernetes-red-hat-openshift) — "Introduction to Containers, Kubernetes, and Red Hat OpenShift (DO180) helps you build core knowledge in managing containers through hands-on experience with containers, Kubernetes, and the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform."

## Process

[If you have to ask... OpenEBS 1.0](https://medium.com/mayadata/if-you-have-to-ask-openebs-1-0-dd4a1663c8a9) — Evan Powell shares, "an entrepreneur’s perspective on what achieving OpenEBS 1.0 means." This is a big deal for any project. MayaData has done some really great work. Evan and the MayaData team have a lot to be proud of.

[Microsoft is teasing Windows 1.0 — yes, from 1985 — for a mystery Stranger Things tie-in](https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/7/5/20683448/microsoft-windows-1-0-stranger-things-season-3-upside-down-july-8) — This should be interesting for us old timers. To be clear, I don't think I got into Windows until the 3.x days, so I'm not that old (haters).

[Making On-Call Not Suck](https://dev.to/molly_struve/making-on-call-not-suck-490) — Molly Struve shares what a long time between on-call rotations do to your team's incident response skills. The team essentially made microservices of their on-call to improve the process and ownership. A very interesting read.

[Distributed Tracing — we’ve been doing it wrong by Cindy Sridharan](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/distributed-tracing-weve-been-doing-it-wrong-39fc92a857df) — "[E]ven if hypothetically all of these problems were to be solved, there’s a good likelihood that nothing much has significantly changed as far as the end user experience is concerned."

## Tools

[Kube Forwarder](https://kube-forwarder.pixelpoint.io/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=135) — Easy to use Kubernetes port forwarding manager. This will help lower the barrier to entry to Kubernetes for some folks.

[The Infrastructure Mess Causing Countless Internet Outages](https://www.wired.com/story/bgp-route-leak-internet-outage/) — "Originally conceived in 1989 (on two napkins), the version of BGP used today remains largely unchanged since 1994." Can confirm. I did a LOT of fun stuff at Langley AFB with BGP back in 2000. It taught me that with great power comes great responsibility in all kinds of new ways.

[Running Kubernetes on Ephemeral Infrastructure](https://ctovision.com/running-kubernetes-on-ephemeral-infrastructure/) — "'Running Kubernetes on Ephemeral Infrastructure', talks about what happens when you run large kubernetes clusters for mission critical enterprise apps and you destroy every node every 48 hours." It's from the folks at Palantir Technologies so take that into account.
