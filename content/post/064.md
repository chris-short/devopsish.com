I'm fresh off the plane from [DevOpsDays Charlotte 2018](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-charlotte/welcome/) when I'm writing this. I have to say a HUGE thank you to the organizers, sponsors, and speakers. [The venue was beyond amazing](https://twitter.com/editingemily/status/966735443436941317). Red Ventures knows how to host a crowd in style. I definitely feel like I need to fly out the morning after these events though. Traveling on a Friday is not ideal. It never fails that I end up missing a connection I wanted to make because I just flat out ran out of time. DevOps is a lot of things. I categorize this newsletter (and DevOps as a whole) into People, Process, and Tools. That is the order of importance; people come first. Always.

[**How to build your first GoCD continuous delivery pipeline?**](https://www.gocd.org/2018/02/13/managing-build-versions-pipeline/?utm_campaign=cd_hacks&utm_medium=newsletter_ad&utm_source=devopsish&utm_content=cd_hacks_no_visual&utm_term=)  
This blog uses a simple web service as an example to show you how to setup your first GoCD continuous delivery pipeline and manage your build version in it.
