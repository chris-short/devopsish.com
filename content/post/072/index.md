This week has been a blur. Monday through Wednesday, I was in Atlanta for DevOpsDays. DevOpsDays Atlanta was a truly great event. The theme was well thought out and the speakers were fantastic. This was the first time I actually manned a booth at an event before too. Talking to total strangers is something I'm okay with. It's a good thing too because there were a ton of visitors to the [SJ Technologies](http://sjtechcorp.com) booth. My talk, [DevOps is Not War](https://chrisshort.net/devopsdays-atlanta-2018-devops-is-not-war/), was on Wednesday. It was a brand new talk, with a brand new presentation tool, and the first time I used Google Slides. Testing in production as one member of the audience stated. I had the opportunity to iron out the kinks on Thursday in Ann Arbor at [AWS Michigan](https://www.meetup.com/AWS-Michigan/events/248874167/) where I gave my second talk in as many days, Heaven is Not a Cloud. Then on Friday, I demoed Kubernetes Cron Jobs to the [Detroit Kubernetes, Docker & all related things](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Kubernetes-Docker-all-things-Cloud-Native/events/249593802/) Meetup. Needless to say, three new talks in three different cities over three consecutive days was a challenge. Could I do it again, yes. Would I voluntarily do it again? 🤔🤔🤪
