**Editor's note**: I cannot ignore the war being waged in Europe. But, this newsletter is a tech newsletter. Generally, the audience responds negatively to "political" news. But, one person's politics, is another person's life. All the [Ukraine news](#ukraine) is here in the notes. Don't if you don't want to see it. [**Skip it**](#notes)!
