If you participated in the DevOps'ish Summer 2018 Survey, thank you. It was vital to make sure I was putting bits in the right places. The [aggregate results are available](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XRAHLduV_ssmPPP_CB_Pbw33LMeaurOfOTEsFDoppkQ/viewanalytics). A few changes you might have noticed last week; [Events](/events/) and [Jobs](/jobs/) now live as pages on the website. While they add value, they also added unnecessary weight to every newsletter. The benefit of them being pages now either of them can be updated as new listings come in. The offer still stands for readers getting their listings on the site for free.

The next cut was the photo header. I thought it was a beautiful thing to add back in 2016. It humanized the newsletter in a way words couldn't. But, the metrics have spoken. With 62 respondents (out of 90) rating it a 5 or less, it was probably past time to pull it. The introduction is staying. Sorry (not sorry) for those of you who think it's too political at times. But, DevOps is about breaking down silos in organizations and I'm about breaking them down in life. Aside from that, not much else is changing.

The newsletter cracked 2,000 this week! Thanks for reading! Tell your friends to subscribe today. [Drop a link](/subscribe/) in your company Slack when you have a moment. I'd like to do some big things in 2019 that will require capital. [Mo' subscriber's, mo' money.](/sponsor/) â€”Notorious B.I.G. (or someone like that).
