+++

As mentioned [last week](https://devopsish.com/106/), I was able to finish [my KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2018 recap](https://chrisshort.net/kubecon-cloudnativecon-na-2018/) this week. It's not an exhaustive list of things I did but, it covers the big ones. One point of emphasis for me was to assess the physical toil I managed along the way. It's important to note that life doesn't stop because you're at a conference. [Videos from the Kubernetes Contributor Summit are now available](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/t/videos-from-the-kubernetes-contributor-summit-are-now-available/3907) too.

I'm on PTO this week. I thought about DevOps'ish taking its first week off ever. But, I don't think that's necessary so here's to over two years of uninterrupted [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/)!

[**Continuous delivery on modern infrastructure - Run GoCD on Kubernetes**](https://www.gocd.org/kubernetes)  
Model Docker-based build workflows more effectively with our GoCD Kubernetes integration. Run GoCD natively on Kubernetes, define your build workflow and let GoCD provision and scale build infrastructure on the fly. *SPONSORED*

[**The real story on container, cloud, and data adoption**](https://www.oreilly.com/pub/cpc/175842)

[DevOps Research and Assessment Joins Google Cloud](https://devops-research.com/2018/12/dora-joins-google-cloud/) â€” I'm happy but, I have mixed feelings. I love the fact Nicole, Jez, and Gene exited to such a great place for their work to flourish.

[How Rancher Discovered the Kubernetes Vulnerability](https://thenewstack.io/how-rancher-discovered-the-kubernetes-vulnerability/) â€” "We identified it. It was kind of kept quiet until the fixed that were pushed out, and then everyone had the ability to patch really quickly last week."

And although all the versions of SSL are now deprecated, it's not likely we'll rebrand back to OpenTLS any time soon."

[Stop Calling Everything Serverless!](https://www.jeremydaly.com/stop-calling-everything-serverless/) â€” The definition of serverless is fuzzier than the definition of DevOps.

In general, AWS Enterprise Support is absolutely phenomenal.

Go TLS servers accepting client certificates and TLS clients are affected." Your software supply chain is VERY important.
