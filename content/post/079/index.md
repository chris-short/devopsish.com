*Trying something different this week and sending out the newsletter on Saturday. Hit Reply and Let me know what you think.*

The big news this week is Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub. Jim Zemlin, Executive Director at The Linux Foundation, provides [a very positive and principled take on the GitHub acquisition](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2018/06/microsoft-buys-github-the-linux-foundations-reaction/). I have been a believer in Microsoft's commitment to open source ever since [they reached out to me](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/691756978679500800) to discuss how they can improve their image in the open source community. Microsoft is apologizing for the Ballmer years profusely with actions (not just words). But, I wonder if Microsoft is buying open source "cool points" too fast? The initial reaction to the acquisition from folks that didn't work at either company was generally negative. When [I discussed how far Microsoft has come](https://chrisshort.net/microsoft-has-come-a-long-way/) back in April, the reaction was also negative. The comments harkened back to an old Microsoft adage, ["Embrace, extend, and extinguish."](https://lobste.rs/s/ldts2j/microsoft_has_come_long_way#c_aa0zyy) I understand peoples' distrust. However, it has been three years since [Microsoft took the keynote stage at All Things Open 2015](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/656457689053138944) to talk about how much they love Linux. They are doing everything right so far. It's time to start taking Microsoft's word (we're not at war). They are going to be good stewards of the open source communities they manage.
