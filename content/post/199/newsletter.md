I was talking to DevOps'ish readers a bit this week in the [DevOps'ish Telegram](https://t.me/devopsish) channel. One reader, in particular, has mentioned in the past that theyâ€™d be willing to help put the newsletter together when Iâ€™m recovering from surgeries or need a day off. This morning I sat down to get a headstart on the newsletter and realized I should instead work on a checklist or HOWTO or whatever it would end up getting called. Let me introduce you to DevOps'ish's **[WRITING.md](https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com/blob/main/WRITING.md#devopsish-writing-process)** file. It details how the newsletter is made and some of the guidelines around writing a newsletter, in general. Itâ€™s made me realize that I need to look into automating more of what I do. Thatâ€™s one of the beautiful parts of checklists or good documentation; it tells you where to start looking into automation points.

Another thing we discussed is profit sharing and how that would have to get figured out. Or rather, we need to talk about how to figure that out. Which then triggered an early afternoon of getting [**GitHub Sponsor**](https://github.com/sponsors/chris-short) and [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/devopsish) up and running. Getting good, long term newsletter sponsors is difficult. Larger newsletters generally outsource it. That seems a little much for me right now. If this system proves to work well, I will flip regular sponsors over to it potentially.

I'm sure every reader gets some value out of [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/). I'd like those willing to contribute to offset the costs and time it takes to research, maintain, and write DevOps'ish to be able to do so. Pay if you want! No shame if you don't. Also, I'm very open to suggestions here.

Also, I'm running an experiment. If you use Product Hunt, [upvote DevOps'ish's Product Hunt listing](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/devops-ish). Yes, I know it's four years old, that's part of the experiment.

Last but not least, if you love reading the news as I do, I would recommend you checking out [Scroll](https://scroll.com/friend/5tcafja7su632ugitrnsnbcvr9) with your extra holiday money. It's a really awesome concept and I hope it catches on like wildfire.

[Research: Women Are Better Leaders During a Crisis](https://hbr.org/2020/12/research-women-are-better-leaders-during-a-crisis)  
Some of my best bosses were women. The article talks about how countries led by women fared better during the pandemic. The writers posit that women have worked on interpersonal skills more than men. The hard stuff like communication, being inspiring, motivational, and collaborative are all traits needed to lead effectively. These aren't "soft skills" at all; they're foundational and core ones.

While I tried to stay upbeat and positive, Ars Technica let us all know what will struggle this year. Zoom's rapid growth has the company on the list. To be honest, I'm already seeing the growing pains there.

This is shady as all get out. "The company and its parent Live Nation admitted to hiring a former employee from rival ticket seller CrowdSurge, then using his knowledge â€” including old usernames and passwords â€” to learn CrowdSurgeâ€™s inner workings and 'cut [the company] off at the knees.'" Holy smokes. Can you believe that? That's some nation state level antics!

"Appleâ€™s market cap jumped by almost $1 trillion this year, followed by Amazon, which increased by over $700 billion." ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ We probably all deserve raises if we're working at successful companies during this pandemic. It's a lot different than normal work.

All those doctor's offices, kiosks, billboards, government offices, and who knows what else ain't getting upgraded. I always turn my head a little sideways at the often antithetical disconnect between tech and medicine.
