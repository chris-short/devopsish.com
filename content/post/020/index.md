Not quite sure what Docker is doing? Few people are. Docker is still Docker except when it's [Moby](https://mobyproject.org/). Moby is open source and Docker isn't (kind of). According to the [official Moby Project announcement](https://blog.docker.com/2017/04/introducing-the-moby-project/), Moby Project is **NEW**! But, Moby Project is actually the new [upstream](https://chrisshort.net/upstream-vs-downstream/) for the Docker project. Interestingly enough, the Moby Project exists to create "An open framework to assemble specialized container systems without reinventing the wheel." (Emphasis added.) The best analysis of the whole S.N.A.F.U. [fittingly comes from The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/21/docker_renames_open_source_code_moby/).

I used [Comic Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans) in the above image because this is a PR fustercluck. The worst part of the announcement was that it was timed REALLY poorly (or not at all). I learned of it when I click a GitHub issue for Docker and it took me to [github.com/moby/moby/issues/4717](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/4717). I legitimately thought something was horribly wrong with GitHub. Nope! All the branding shenanigans appeared to happen all at once during DockerCon.

Containers are hard to explain to people because [containers aren't really a thing](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/). Linux containers are a combination of pre-existing Linux kernel components. The Founder of Docker, Solomon Hykes, [tweeted out two sketches to explain the Moby Project](https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/855918630915133440). The fact that this was necessary shows how awkward this is to explain. Now, the container waters are even muddier than they already were by this rough re-branding effort.

Friend of DevOps'ish [Mattias Geniar has officially launched DNS Spy](https://ma.ttias.be/dns-spy-launched/)!

## Department of Story Time

This [Microsoft Flight Simulator support case](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170418-00/?p=95985) reminds me of a call I answered when I worked at a dial-up ISP. The customer called in late at night to figure out why he couldn't get online. It was late but, I was in the office because of a bad thunderstorm potentially affecting phone lines, modems, etc. I went through several troubleshooting steps only to find out that there was nothing being displayed on his monitor. When I asked if his monitor was turned on he informed me the power was out due to the storm. I was dumbfounded that this seemingly intelligent human did not realize his computer wasn't powered by the phone line. He asked, "If I can call you, why can't I get online?" I can't...
