## Independence Day

Happy Independence Day to my friends and family in the United States. I have a lot of mixed feelings on this day. But, we should note that independence is hard-won. The United States declared its independence in 1776. But, it took eight years of war and bringing in two British enemies (Spain and France) in the process. What has followed is one of the best examples of enemies turned BFFs in our world today (it did take time, though). There's much to be gleaned here about creating allies out of opponents. It is often necessary when going through any transformation. Your detractors, once convinced, can become your biggest allies. If this piqued your interest, check out my talk, [DevOps is Not War](https://chrisshort.net/video/devops-not-war-chefconf-2018/).

## I Made Some Shinies

I've been busy the past few weeks. I often have or create side projects on which I want to spend time while traveling. You might remember [I was at Open Source Summit](https://devopsish.com/273) last month. During the week of Open Source Summit, my side project was to build out [my ultimate development environment: code-server, Caddy, Tailscale, and Hugo](https://devopsi.sh/env). It was super helpful to be able to ping the fine folks in the [Coder](https://coder.com/) booth when I had questions walking in or out of the venue that day. I call it "[W]onderful, like unicorns and rainbows, y'all. ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ" It is where newsletters, blog posts,  [landing pages](https://chrisshort.me/) (I need to write a blog post on that), and all the YAMLs are being created these days (public repos only for obvious reasons).

## Changing Roles at AWS

This week has had its ups and downs. [More downs than ups](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1542547822888849410), to be honest. But, I tried like hell to crank out all the work that needed to be updated to start a new role come Tuesday. Let me make this abundantly clear now. There's nothing wrong with the EKS Developer Advocate team. It's truly an amazingly talented group. Also, I'm staying at AWS (yes, I like it here, and they've done right by me and my family, big time).

### Amazon EKS Developer Advocate

In 249 days, we've churned out a `multi-cluster-gitops` project I highlighted at Open Source Summit in the AWS booth. We've also built a successful newsletter that, in 22 issues, has ~1500 subscribers without a dime of Marketing support. We worked in the upstream Kubernetes project to get through ALL the `dockershim` work with the community leads guiding our hands. A role in which I ensured there were always too many people named Chris in the group. The `dockershim` work alone could've been all I did for 249 days; it felt like some weeks, at least. But working upstream with my colleagues brings me so much joy. We're agile and can chip in where the work is complex and intertwined.

### Community work

I'm not stopping all my contributions to cloud native and Kubernetes altogether, oh no. I intend to use the trust I've built within the Kubernetes community to help make it a more diverse and welcoming place. You'll find me in #github-management more as that's a function that's more my speed (especially after deep diving into it late in the afternoon on Friday). No leadership capacity there; merely chipping in to help bring more folks into the project. I'll also remain an advisor to the [Contributor Comms](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team) team (a role I'm finally settling into, I hope; Kaslin is the real judge there). I did step down effective 1 July 2022 as [GitOps WG](https://github.com/cncf/tag-app-delivery/tree/main/gitops-wg) co-chair (that was a tough but necessary decision).

You'll be seeing me around in my new role too. I'm heading over to work on a new project that I'm VERY excited about. I had the idea for such a thing last year but ultimately shelved it because I was too busy to support such a project at the time. Now it's going to be my job to make this idea very much into a reality. To briefly quote the job description, "[Y]ou will focus primarily on open source projects, integrations, and related workflows. Developer experience, CI/CD, and end-to-end container image lifecycle are all in scope."
