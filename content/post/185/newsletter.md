My daughter just informed me she very likely has contracted COVID-19. My apologies but, I'm going to forgo my usual introduction in the newsletter this week.

I was going to discuss this lengthy piece but, give it a read instead: [The Developer-Led Landscape](https://tylerjewell.substack.com/p/the-developer-led-landscape-20-08-28).

**DevOps'ish is brought to you by** [**Accurics**](https://www.accurics.com/). They're cool people doing cool things with cloud native security. Check them out!

## People

[Kubernetes Contributors](https://www.kubernetes.dev/)  
"It is intended to be the hub for all things related to the Kubernetes Contributor experience. Who exactly is a contributor? We all are - Whether you‚Äôre writing docs, reviewing code, participating in the community and its many [Special Interest Groups] SIGs, everyone is welcome. We hope this site will be a pathway to success for our 35000+ Kubernetes contributors, providing current, up-to-date information on community events, contributor resources, Kubernetes SIGs, and more."

One lone hero in production is not sustainable-not for you, not for high-functioning teams, and not for customers who depend on your service. Collaborate well by instrumenting observability from the very beginning, and enable more resilient teams to build more reliable systems sustainably.

In our guide, [Developing a Culture of Observability](https://info.honeycomb.io/developing-a-culture-of-observability-devopsish?&utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ad&utm_content=developing-a-culture-of-observability-devopsish), we lay out why o11y culture and tools go hand-in-hand.

[Microsoft warns hackers are actively targeting Zerologon vulnerability. Patch pronto!](https://grahamcluley.com/microsoft-warns-hackers-are-actively-targeting-zerologon-vulnerability-patch-pronto/)  
This is being called the worst bug in Windows history. Like, I don't know how much more fucking terrified into patching your systems you should be but, if you haven't patched your systems by the time you're reading this, you've got some serious explaining to do.

[Don't Compare Averages](https://martinfowler.com/articles/dont-compare-averages.html)  
Comparing averages or even [trying to determine an average in some cases](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html) (if you've never read this piece you should) can be a horrible, no good, awful practice.

[10 Best Practices Worth Implementing to Adopt Kubernetes](https://containerjournal.com/topics/container-management/10-best-practices-worth-implementing-to-adopt-kubernetes/)  
Not a terrible list.

[The Windows XP source code was allegedly leaked online](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/the-windows-xp-source-code-was-allegedly-leaked-online/)  
The next few weeks should be interesting in terms of low level Windows things being discovered. Of course, now that it's leaked, can we actually use it in any other application ever? What if there are bits in here that aren't licensed properly and invoke lawsuits? What if it somehow exposes a monopolistic plot? Who knows what'll happen! üçøüçøüçøüçøüçø

[Snyk Acquires DeepCode to Apply AI to DevSecOps](https://devops.com/snyk-acquires-deepcode-to-apply-ai-to-devsecops/)  
It's my understanding that Snyk is or at least was in a hardcore acquisition mode.

[Why Magic Leap Failed: AR Hype Exceeded Product's Capabilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-09-23/why-magic-leap-failed-ar-hype-exceeded-product-s-capabilities)  
Next time, call me before you spend over $10 million on something. I'll tell you if it's legit or not for $250K. Dead serious.

## Tools

[Download today: Kubernetes security ebook - tips, tricks, best practices](https://security.stackrox.com/kubernetes-security-ebook-tips-tricks-best-practices.html?Source=DevOpsish&LSource=DevOpsish)  
The rapid adoption of Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads is driving great efficiencies in application development, deployment, and scalability. However, when security becomes an afterthought, you risk diminishing the greatest gain of containerization - agility. [Download this ebook](https://security.stackrox.com/kubernetes-security-ebook-tips-tricks-best-practices.html?Source=DevOpsish&LSource=DevOpsish) to learn how to (1) build secure images and prevent untrusted/vulnerable code, (2) configure RBAC, network policies, and runtime privileges, (3) detect unauthorized runtime activity, and (4) secure your Kubernetes infrastructure components such as the API server. *SPONSORED*

[I'm losing trust in AWS. SNS is broken for 24 days.](https://cloudonaut.io/loosing-trust-in-aws-sns-broken-for-24-days/)  
"I'm frustrated. A major service of AWS is broken for 24 days. The Simple Notification Service (SNS) delivers messages to HTTPS subscriptions with a delay of more than 30 minutes. That issue impacts our SaaS business. But AWS did not fix the problem yet and did not even reveal an ETA for resolving the issue." And no one I reached out to at AWS has said a damn thing in response to me. Not a good look, y'all.

"This post will detail Linkerd's CI journey from a single, persistent Kubernetes cluster to theoretically unlimited one-off kind clusters. This journey includes a few detours on what patterns and tools worked well (and not so well) for Linkerd's use case."

[Meet the ‚ÄòDPU' - accelerated network cards designed to go where CPUs and GPUs can't be bothered](https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/25/smartnic_dpu/)  
General purpose processors are going to start becoming userland in a hurry. With the shot in the Arm Nvidia has, there'll be single purpose chips, ASICs, and FPGAs like we've never thought or heard of before raining from the heavens.

Todoist just murdered Trello with a throat slit in the dark of night, in my opinion. I went Pro on Todoist the second the board feature went into beta. It's life changing.
