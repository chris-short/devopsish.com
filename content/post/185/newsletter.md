## People

[Kubernetes Contributors](https://www.kubernetes.dev/)  
"It is intended to be the hub for all things related to the Kubernetes Contributor experience. Who exactly is a contributor? We all are - Whether youâ€™re writing docs, reviewing code, participating in the community and its many [Special Interest Groups] SIGs, everyone is welcome. We hope this site will be a pathway to success for our 35000+ Kubernetes contributors, providing current, up-to-date information on community events, contributor resources, Kubernetes SIGs, and more."

One lone hero in production is not sustainable-not for you, not for high-functioning teams, and not for customers who depend on your service. Collaborate well by instrumenting observability from the very beginning, and enable more resilient teams to build more reliable systems sustainably.
