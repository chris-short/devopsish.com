We are very fortunate. I remind myself of that every day. Our household's collective efforts have put us where we are today (being some random dude from a town called Hickory; this is far further than I'd ever imagined). I have been posting pictures from my new office that we custom built in our basement. I'm very fortunate to have a room, with a solid door and some soundproofing, to work from in these times. The only thing to bother me are the things I let into my day.

It was funny, the other day, when I got a knock on the door and two of my nephews rolled in with Max and Julie. "Wow, Uncle Chris! I didn't realize you were down here!" "Oh wow, Uncle Chris! I love your office!" Even the kids think it's cool. Like I said, very fortunate.

This weekend I live tweeted cleaning out two bins FULL of cables. Lots of old memories brought up. All normal and some great memories. Now, I'm in a space that is just for *me*. Julie has a space just for herself as well. Both getting improved upon a little bit more every day.

I'm iterating on a consistent theme, "Optimize storage space (create as much as possible and use it as effectively as possible), recycle, right-size, or dispose. Do not keep anything unless you think you might need it based off what's *in this house*." It is an incredibly wonderful feeling to be organized. It is how I maintain a usually high level of productivity. I will admit, when my workspace is chaotic, I'm chaotic. Maximizing and optimizing every little thing to your desired state of eventual balance requires not overthinking things. What's the dead simplest way to achieve X? Will you appreciate seeing this every day?

Some pictures still need to be hung. But, I've been operational down here for a couple weeks now. I can genuinely say I've fulfilled a long time dream of working from home, in an office that has been made to optimize my productivity and comfort. Flexible yet reliable. With an awesome play space for the kids when they want to come over. It's a balance of the best of both worlds in what is now my third and hopefully last office in this house.

I don't think this helps or hurts me as a new employee. But, a lot of my coworkers are about to get happier.

[Multiple Security Flaws Discovered in Popular Software Package Managers](https://thehackernews.com/2022/03/multiple-security-flaws-discovered-in.html)  
"But the newly discovered issues in various package managers highlight that they could be weaponized by attackers to trick victims into executing malicious code."

[Privilege Escalation Vulnerability CVE-2022-0492 and its impact on Kubernetes](https://www.armosec.io/blog/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-cve-2022-0492-kubernetes/)  
"Until you upgraded the base kernel image to the fixed version or applied a specific temporary patch, your node is vulnerable."

"As summarized above, the majority of the traditional Kubernetes resources may have better alternatives for developers. Using alternatives will improve how we develop and operate cloud-native applications in the years to come. After all, Kubernetes is a platform for building platforms. It’s not the end-game!"

[Scripting with Go](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/scripting)  
"I'm not saying shell scripting is obsolete. I still use a lot of shell scripts myself. There is a large problem domain where shell is absolutely the right answer. But small programs tend to grow into large ones, and when that happens, it's nice to be able to use the facilities of a language that was designed for programming at scale."

[Announcing automated multi-cluster failover for Kubernetes](https://linkerd.io/2022/03/09/announcing-automated-multi-cluster-failover-for-kubernetes/)  
"This feature gives Linkerd the ability to automatically redirect all traffic from a failing or inaccessible service to one or more replicas of that service—including replicas on other clusters."
