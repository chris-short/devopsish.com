**Editor's note**: I cannot ignore Putin's war being waged in Europe. But, this newsletter is a tech newsletter. However, as I've discovered I cannot unlearn my previous life's skills. I have been thanked for providing another perspective to coverage of the war in Ukraine. One person's politics, is another person's life. All the [Ukraine news](#ukraine) is below the regular notes. If you don't want to hear about it, don't scroll down to it. If you think I should break this off into a separate blog, I'm open to doing that.
