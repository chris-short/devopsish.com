I'm going to keep the monologue pretty short this week. I have some lightly scoped out ideas to share in 2018 though so don't worry, lots more to come. It has been [a rough week in the Short household](https://chrisshort.net/miscarriage-a-culture-of-silence-helps-no-one/) and I'm mentally spent. But, there was a ton DevOps, Cloud Native, and open source of news this week. I hope you had a Happy Hanukkah or Happy Festivus and I wish all of you a Merry Christmas.
