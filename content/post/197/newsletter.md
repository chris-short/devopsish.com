This being a holiday break my intros will probably be a little bit shorter than normal. "More punchy" as my first boss at Red Hat would say. Let's start with the thing with an ever increasing blast radius: **Solarwinds**.

## Solarwinds Supply Chain Compromise

For the record, Reuters has been all over this coverage wise. I can't do them justice. This story has been evolving so rapidly that by the time I hit send, my coverage will be incomplete. Everything from Russian hackers to insider trading to putting a global sinkhole in place for the command and control (C2) domain.

This is a truly terrifying compromise at a company [I genuinely enjoyed working for in the past](https://chrisshort.net/resume/). No, I never touched the Orion product while I worked there. Perhaps I should have. But, over the years, I've been in contact with more places than I can count that use Solarwinds Orion. It really is everywhere that has a big enough footprint to justify it. Governments included. This might turn out to be bigger than the OPM hack when the dust settles. I decided to build an [Index](https://devopsish.com/categories/Indexes) page to provide continuing coverage of the [**Solarwinds supply chain compromise**](https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/). When in doubt, go to this page for vetted info.

There's already a lot of coverage and it will continue to grow. Here's where you the reader can help round out the coverage. Feel free to add missing links yourself (and help me enjoy my down time a little more); [pull requests welcome](https://github.com/chris-short/devopsish.com/) or you can e-mail or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort).

[Use OKRs to Set Goals for Teams, Not Individuals](https://hbr.org/2020/12/use-okrs-to-set-goals-for-teams-not-individuals)  
This drove me a little batty at one employer. Now I at least no why. "Setting individual OKRs generally leads to goals that are either not true indications of meaningful progress or that are easily gameable. Instead, individual contributors should be assessed based on the extent to which their work contributes to team goals that add real value to the company and its customers."

[State of Women in Tech Report 2020](https://womenwhotech.com/data-and-resources/state-women-tech-and-startups)  
Women Who Tech's annual report shows that half of women founders have been harassed in the past twelve months; 41% of that harassment was sexual harassment. "Nearly 50% of women founders were told they would raise more money if they were a man." Additionally, "Women in tech aren’t reporting the harassment they experience to senior leadership at the same rate as they have previously." WOMEN DESERVE BETTER! Forward this to a scumbag you know. Tell them you expect better. The only way we stop this vile and insane behavior is by having people that look like the scumbags standing up against them. They're bullies and criminals, they should be treated and dealt with as such. I'm tired of this shit and I'm pulling cards in 2021, believe that.

NET4 India sounds like an awful registrar. Now they're out of business with their director in prison for fraud. Hundreds of thousands of domains now remain in limbo.
