No. Contrary to what everyone I've talked to this week thinks, I'm not going to KubeCon Barcelona. I don't think I was really planning on it at the beginning of the year. I believe it was added to my schedule right before my Shingles diagnosis. Let me tell you, Shingles is bullshit. I've been battling a flare-up of the nerve pain today and it's gnarly af. I was going to discuss the use of the term "best practice" this week but, I need to go get some rest. Instead, lend me your thoughts. [The Tweet of the Week this week](https://twitter.com/Kate_Catlin/status/1128403226678587393) provides the thinking behind modifying or eliminating the use of the phrase "best practices". [I asked for clarification from the greater community this week](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1129342806307278848) and the conversation was insightful. Check it all out and let me know what you think (Twitter, email, Telegram, etc.)!

If the problem is a struggle to innovate, then the solution is greater diversity and inclusion.

[The Price of the Hallway Track](https://hynek.me/articles/hallway-track/) — The hallway track is when I make actual connections with people. The talks I go to are because I want to engage with the speaker on the topic or the discussion in general. But, if you go to conferences and ignore all talks, you're doing the speakers a very real disservice.

[They Were Promised Coding Jobs in Appalachia. Now They Say It Was a Fraud.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/12/us/mined-minds-west-virginia-coding.html) — "Mined Minds came into West Virginia espousing a certain dogma, fostered in the world of start-ups and TED Talks. Students found an erratic operation." "Out of the 10 or so people who made it to the final weeks of Ms. Frame's [Mined Minds] class in Beckley, only one formally graduated. He is now delivering takeout."

It's also a workforce that isn't here to punch a clock. We want to make an actual impact and fully utilize our skills to do it. Facebook's bad behavior leading to recruiting problems should surprise absolutely no one.

[The struggles of an open source maintainer](http://antirez.com/news/129) — "That said, I was able to work for many years doing things I really loved, that gave me friends, recognition, money, so I don't want to say it was a bad deal.

[cpu.fail](https://cpu.fail) — Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) and a group of vulnerabilities individually known as ZombieLoad, RIDL, and Fallout have been disclosed publicly. [Every processor Intel made since 2011](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/zombieload-attack-intel-what-to-do,news-30082.html) is impacted by these vulnerabilities. In my opinion, Arm is the future now. I wouldn't be surprised if organizations accelerated plans investing in Arm or switching architectures to Arm. Arm is by no means flawless but, Intel is not going to easily overcome this. Why? [Google Cloud is advising GKE customers](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/9330250) they, "must disable hyper-threading." Truly mitigating these vulnerabilities means you will have half the CPUs you thought you did. Fellow Red Hatter Jon Masters has [an extended MDS explanation video](https://youtu.be/Xn-wY6Ir1hw) and [MDS blog post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/understanding-mds-vulnerability-what-it-why-it-works-and-how-mitigate-it) explaining more.

When the patches do arrive, Cisco says, they will 'require an on-premise reprogramming,' meaning the fixes can't be pushed remotely, because they are so fundamental."

Remember the ransom attacks that hit Git repos (see [DevOps'ish 126](https://devopsish.com/126/))?
