Editor's Note: The newsletter passed 3,975 subscribers this week. I'd love to end the month at 4,000 subscribers. If you don't mind, please ask your coworkers, BFFs, and folks on social media to [subscribe to DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/). Y'all stay awesome!

I'm exhausted. I tweeted midweek that I likely shortened my lifespan at KubeCon this week and I wasn't sure why. It was a net negative experience for me. The people are great. I love meeting contributors and teaching new folks how to contribute. But, the problems that had to be solved on the ground were extreme in some cases. I sent out my unpolished report internally. I will share it when I have the energy to clean it up a lot.

I can tell you for certain, I'm not the only one that feels this way. One CNCF Ambassador already hung it up. I have legitimate concerns about the long term viability of Cloud Native Computing Foundation. At this rate of disregard for the communities forming underneath it, the intent seems to get as much money as possible at all costs. It's frustrating as hell and I'm still mulling what to do. If I end up leaving my CNCF Ambassador title behind, it would free up some time to do more in the community. I will not do a full KubeCon again.
