## Process

[The Dark Side of DevOps](https://youtu.be/gi-i5NvxVLM) — People think that DevOps, Cloud Native, Agile, GROWS, etc. are all rainbows and roses. You start small, work your way up or you decide as an organizational unit to change. These are two patterns associated with a Jedi-type maturation process of DevOps. Like in Star Wars, DevOps has a dark side. This talk by Chris Short of Red Hat provides examples of successful and failed DevOps transformations, as well as some lessons learned along the way.

## Tools

[BPF Performance Tools by Brendan Gregg](https://amzn.to/2z6EeTi) (Amazon) — Pre-order The BPF version of Homer's Odyssey today! Seriously it's 700 pages, y'all. I'm certain it's worth every penny though.
