Monday, August 19, will be my first day as a Principal Technical Marketing Manager on the Cloud Platforms team at Red Hat. What does that mean? OpenShift, Kubernetes, containers, and all manner of things that go along with that will be my day job. Helping folks help themselves with technology is still and always will be name of my game. This was a 2020 goal (working full time in the Kubernetes or cloud native ecosystem) and I was able to do it in 2019. #winning

But, my involvement with Ansible won't end like a Thanos finger snap. I am still involved in AnsibleFest (see you in ATL). I'm also acting as an Ansible knowledge source for folks on the Cloud Platforms team. Part of my charge when joining Red Hat was to bring more collaboration between the Ansible and OpenShift teams. That has been happening and I hope to continue building on the collaboration happening between both teams.

One thing I wrote when I announced I was joining the Ansible team was, "[I'd like to work to see what Ansible can bring to CNCF projects.](https://chrisshort.net/joining-ansible-team-at-red-hat/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=141)" The fact you can write Kubernetes Operators with Ansible and that [Ansible Operators](https://ansible.com/operators/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=141&utm_term=kubernetes) are now a priority is something I hope I can hang my hat on. Let's face it, *more people know how to write Ansible than Go*. Ansible's future is it's ability to be learned and be effective with quickly. The more that methodology can be applied in the Kubernetes and OpenShift realms the better off both products will be and so will their communities.

Thank you to the Ansible team for shepherding me into Red Hat, welcoming me with open arms, and sharing your knowledge with me. You have all been wonderful teammates and we'll continue to work together as Red Hatters.

## Process

[The Dark Side of DevOps](https://youtu.be/gi-i5NvxVLM) — People think that DevOps, Cloud Native, Agile, GROWS, etc. are all rainbows and roses. You start small, work your way up or you decide as an organizational unit to change. These are two patterns associated with a Jedi-type maturation process of DevOps. Like in Star Wars, DevOps has a dark side. This talk by Chris Short of Red Hat provides examples of successful and failed DevOps transformations, as well as some lessons learned along the way.
