re:Invent is easier to cover when it's not in e-mail form.

[Commentary: Andy Jassy aims to reinvent Amazon Web Services for the cloud's next generation](https://siliconangle.com/2019/12/01/commentary-andy-jassy-aims-reinvent-amazon-web-services-clouds-next-generation/) — "In an exclusive one-on-one conversation, Amazon’s cloud chief reveals how he views the future of the cloud, the competition, market shifts, customer demands and controversies"

[AWS Managed Cassandra Launches: First They Came for Kafka...](https://www.cbronline.com/news/aws-managed-cassandra) — AWS is going to make millions but, they'll give the community $100K... in AWS credits.

[Amazon Braket: Get Started with Quantum Computing](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-braket-get-started-with-quantum-computing/) — I do agree with AWS on this, it will be a long time before quantum computing becomes as ubiquitous classical computation. A cloud solution is going to be needed to boost this technology into the future.

[With Compute Optimizer, AWS Finds an Actual Use For AI/ML](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/with-compute-optimizer-aws-finds-an-actual-use-for-ai-ml/) — AWS is doing something long needed and wanted by a lot of customers.

[Amazon EKS on AWS Fargate Now Generally Available](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-on-aws-fargate-now-generally-available/) — More from re:Invent... I would like control planeless pods at this point. Charge me on resource limit reservations and usage. Have K8s deployment, will travel.

[AWS Now Available from a Local Zone in Los Angeles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-now-available-from-a-local-zone-in-los-angeles/) — Not a region, not an availability zone. Local zones aim to put AWS resources closer to where users are and are managed under existing regions (LA is tied to us-west-2). Think of it as CDN for AWS services.
