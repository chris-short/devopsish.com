## Events

[DeliveryConf](https://www.deliveryconf.com/)  
Seattle, WA  
January 21-22, 2020  
DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is being held to give people a place to get deeper technical information about Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Our goal isn't to just tell you to "do the technical thing"; it is to show you real world examples of how others have done it. DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is a not-for-profit event being created by an all-volunteer team with many years of experience both in the technology and with creating conferences.

Also, yes, you can build CRDs with Ansible. Awesome stuff happens when folks discover the Operator Framework and Ansible work well together. Huge thanks to Jeff Geerling.
