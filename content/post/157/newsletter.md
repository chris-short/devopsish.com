I had a long week with a lot of ups and downs. But, the real downer was delivered on Friday afternoon when I learned my insurance provider had denied a trial run at a new nerve stimulator. I had been talking to friends and family about this new nerve stimulator because it was way less invasive to implant. In a nutshell, the nerve stimulator is synthesized to produce a cancellation signal that keeps the brain from feeling the pain. One friend described it as being akin to Iron Man. Instead of keeping metal out of my heart, the nerve stimulator would keep pain from my brain. It also featured technology like Bluetooth and wireless power which means that I could have a cordless device that's inert in my body with no exposed wiring. No issue with TSA or any government facilities I might find myself in or around again someday (never know if or when a friend will call). Back to the drawing board...

I know that may sound crazy, and many of you are probably already reaching for the ‘close tab’ button, but hear me out."

These scripts, potentially served to millions of users across the internet, hijack the users’ connections to make multiple requests against the targeted site. These requests consume all the resources of the targeted site, making it unavailable" We should all be afraid of this.

## Tools

[Container Security: Fundamental Technology Concepts that Protect Containerized Applications](https://amzn.to/3414GL5) — "Many organizations are running applications in cloud native environments, using containers and orchestration to facilitate scalability and resilience. But how do you know whether your deployment is secure? To fully grasp the security implications of containers and their operation, you need an understanding of what they are and how they work. This practical book dives into the underlying technologies and components that these systems rely on to leave you better equipped to assess the security risks and potential solutions applicable to your environment. Author Liz Rice explores the building blocks and security boundaries commonly used in container-based systems and how they’re constructed in Linux."

[Digging Into etcd by Benjamin Elder](https://elder.dev/posts/digging-into-etcd/) — "Kubernetes uses etcd as the backing store for cluster data, which drove my own interest in collecting the information in this post.

[Gardener Project Update](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/12/02/gardener-project-update/) — "Gardener’s main principle is to leverage Kubernetes primitives for all of its operations, commonly described as inception or kubeception. The feedback from the community was that initially our architecture diagram looks “overwhelming”, but after some little digging into the material, everything we do is the 'Kubernetes way'. One can re-use all learnings with respect to APIs, control loops, etc."

Also, they needed a cost-efficient solution when scaling down or to configure complex scaling conditions."
