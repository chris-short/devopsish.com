## Notes

It is worth pointing out that the metrics based system I use to help write DevOps'ish has broken. I lost the ability to post to Twitter due to rate limiting of Tweets sent via IFTTT. I'm looking for a solution but, to be honest, I'd like to build an open source tool to handle my [DIY Buffer using IFTTT](https://chrisshort.net/drawings/diy-buffer-using-ifttt/). But, I don't have the skills to do it nor the time, even if I did. If you're interested in working on such a project, let me know.
