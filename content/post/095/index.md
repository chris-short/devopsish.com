I will be in Austin, TX Sunday through Thursday this week for [AnsibleFest](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest). If you are attending, please come say, "Hello." and ask me for some [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/) stickers, please.

[The dark side of conferences](https://uxdesign.cc/the-dark-side-of-conferences-4b103143179f): "Like the click baity title? Nice! Now let's talk about the 'glamorous' conference life." I can definitely relate to everything in this. I don't cry myself to sleep though. That stopped long, long ago. Don't get me wrong, I'm very fortunate to be able to travel. But, I'm also fortunate enough to know I need to say no more (still).

[Business Travel Life: Chris Short](https://www.tripit.com/blog/2018/09/business-travel-tips-chris-short.html): Coincidentally, I was profiled in a new business travel life series from TripIt this week.

[Lyft unveils second annual diversity report](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/lyft-unveils-second-annual-diversity-report/): Not bad given the rapid growth. But, still, work to be done.

## Process

[5 red flags in the Instagram founders' goodbye letter to Facebook that make it obvious there's bad blood](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-goodbye-letter-clues-facebook-breakup-2018-9): How you resign matters. Also, if you want an example of throwing a hand grenade in an envelope and sending it to Zuck, this is it.

[You Gave Facebook Your Number For Security. They Used It For Ads.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/you-gave-facebook-your-number-security-they-used-it-ads): Facebook is the worst.

[Facebook blocked users from posting some stories about its security breach](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/facebook-blocks-guardian-story/): Further evidence of worstedness.

[Slack has made its biggest acquisition to date](https://qz.com/work/1392936/slack-has-made-its-biggest-acquisition-to-date/): Did you even hear about it?

[Ooof! Cisco Webex has been down for 7 hours – and counting](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/25/cisco_webex_down_outage/): I almost took a job at AppDynamics once. One of the reasons I decided to stop pursuing that opportunity was horrible interviews due to WebEx. If I have to use a tool every day to work, it needs to get through the interviews okay.

[Pain spotting: Russia's Aeroflot Docker server lands internal source code, config files on public internet](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/26/aeroflot_server_code_open/): Container images leak through insecure registry

[Pentagon Extends JEDI Deadline Again—With a Catch](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2018/09/pentagon-extends-jedi-deadline-again-catch/151541/): The department is requiring bidders to deliver their proposals in person.

While the Internet is still whole it's nearly impossible for a Chinese citizen to legally see anything outside of what China allows. Foreign businesses also can't wholly own their presence in China and must use a partner (who is likely in bed with government). This isn't a matter of if when the split occurs but whether or not that split will speed up or not.
