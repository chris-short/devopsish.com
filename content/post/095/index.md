## Process

[5 red flags in the Instagram founders' goodbye letter to Facebook that make it obvious there's bad blood](https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-founder-kevin-systrom-goodbye-letter-clues-facebook-breakup-2018-9): How you resign matters. Also, if you want an example of throwing a hand grenade in an envelope and sending it to Zuck, this is it.

[You Gave Facebook Your Number For Security. They Used It For Ads.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/09/you-gave-facebook-your-number-security-they-used-it-ads): Facebook is the worst.

[Facebook blocked users from posting some stories about its security breach](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/28/facebook-blocks-guardian-story/): Further evidence of worstedness.

[Slack has made its biggest acquisition to date](https://qz.com/work/1392936/slack-has-made-its-biggest-acquisition-to-date/): Did you even hear about it?

[Ooof! Cisco Webex has been down for 7 hours – and counting](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/25/cisco_webex_down_outage/): I almost took a job at AppDynamics once. One of the reasons I decided to stop pursuing that opportunity was horrible interviews due to WebEx. If I have to use a tool every day to work, it needs to get through the interviews okay.

[Pain spotting: Russia's Aeroflot Docker server lands internal source code, config files on public internet](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/26/aeroflot_server_code_open/): Container images leak through insecure registry

[2018 Tech Impact Awards, Cloud: Heptio](https://www.seattlebusinessmag.com/technology/2018-tech-impact-awards-cloud-heptio): The Seattle-based company now has 90 employees

[LinkedIn steps into business intelligence with the launch of Talent Insights](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/linkedin-talent-insights/): Long story short, LinkedIn has started making more business type applications and less social network applications.

[Salesforce dogged by protests, leaked emails, and guerrilla blimps on first day of Dreamforce](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/26/salesforce_dreamforce/): Oh, and the last shreds of Metallica's credibility disappearing on stage

[Introducing Microsoft.com/Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/teamblog/introducing-ms-learn): "announcing the release of our new learning website called Microsoft Learn – the best place to start learning Microsoft technologies."

[A Silicon Valley Start-Up That Loves the Pentagon](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/26/a-silicon-valley-startup-that-loves-the-pentagon-hivemapper-dod-google/): Google may balk at military contracts, but Hivemapper founder Ariel Seidman believes working with the U.S. Defense Department can help save lives.

[Former Google CEO predicts the internet will split in two  — and one part will be led by China](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/eric-schmidt-ex-google-ceo-predicts-internet-split-china.html): To be honest, I think this has already happened. While the Internet is still whole it's nearly impossible for a Chinese citizen to legally see anything outside of what China allows. Foreign businesses also can't wholly own their presence in China and must use a partner (who is likely in bed with government). This isn't a matter of if when the split occurs but whether or not that split will speed up or not.
