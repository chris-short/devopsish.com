Hi all, if you thought last week was bad, I give you this week. I'm not going to add on to the already well detailed list from last week. Instead, I'd like to celebrate something.

## Happy Birthday, DevOps'ish

DevOps'ish turns five years old today! Max was a year old. I told my wife I was starting a newsletter. Two-hundred forty-seven issues later, we've arrived here. This morning, I told Julie who, thought I was absolutely nuts at the time, that DevOps'ish is one of the best things I've done for my career. This has paid off on the home front as well in terms of improving our overall quality of life. I guess this shouldn't come as a surprise, but the newsletter also enabled [MORE charitable giving](https://chrisshort.net/causes) than before too. Has DevOps'ish been a success? [Yes](https://devopsish.com/praise/).

### DevOps'ish at 5

Is the newsletter self-sustaining? Yes. I've optimized costs as much as possible. I've filled sponsorships as much as I want. The balance sheet is good. The newsletter has pivoted from being a very metrics focused newsletter to being very privacy aware over its five years of existence. I don't want to know anything about the DevOps'ish readership unless they volunteer it. I don't track clicks or open rates and I'm very upfront about that with sponsors.

Moving off Google Analytics and going to Fathom Analytics was another win for the privacy conscious. Fathom has also added on to the excellent services they offer too. Another good move was getting off Mailchimp. It was bumpy for a little bit, but EmailOctopus provides a great service for newslettering. It is also privacy conscious in that it allows me to turn off tracking features normally enabled by default and not changeable on other platforms. I hope readers understand and appreciate the great lengths gone to in the name of privacy.

This past month, after being on Netlify for years now, I finally had to start a paid plan. I'm literally buying time as I think through how to refactor the DevOps'ish website to optimize for build times. I could write a whole blog post about the one dumb design decision that has created an infrastructure problem for myself (and I probably will at some point). But, I can buy time, as I said. Which is nice given how hectic life is right now.

### DevOps'ish going from 5 to 10

One area where I'm not thrilled with the newsletter is in the subscriber count. By sharing how I feel or how one thing interacts with a societal structure thus "politics" are discussed in the newsletter leads to a narrowing of the audience. This leaves me with a choice: A) don't associate anything political thing with anything in tech (like purist think it should be; which also isn't reality) or B) make me more aware of their surroundings.

Needless to say, I'm going to choose option B. That will rub people the wrong way. The worst thing that can happen to DevOps'ish is subscriber count stagnation. The privacy policies discussed earlier mean the only metric I can sell sponsors on is the number of subscribers. The success of this newsletter lies with its ability to get folks to subscribe to it. I see a referral program in the future. But, I feel like that also means a swag shop for rewards too. These are all great things. But, it's work too and takes time to manage. If you know of a great swag store or agency let me know. I haven't done much research into it because I haven't had the time.

An interesting fact about DevOps'ish: it isn't a marketing tool or a tool used to sell something (outside of native ads in the newsletter itself). It's used to inform people. Which puts it in a weird position for marketing to folks. I've done Twitter Ads in the past with some success. Right now I'm testing Google Ads (as gross as that sounds). Buying subscribers is a loss leader but, the native Google Ads experience is actually bringing people to the site. But, this relatively high price for a subscriber is not lost on me. But, these are small, manageable ad runs once or twice a year. I need to figure out the best way to put money back into the newsletter to keep it growing still.

### DevOps'ish in 2022

It's actually really wild thinking about it now. But, going into 2022, I want to make really sure this newsletter is something I want to focus on. Is it still worth the time?

I read a lot (and I always will) but, I'm not necessarily reading what I want to (I used to read books). I'm burning down an unread count in Inoreader (which they are making easier to do). I think one thing I can do in 2022 is start to read less of the mainstream tech news sites (The Register, Wired, etc.) and more of the cool work y'all are putting on your blogs. This would cut down on the amount of reading significantly. I'm at a point now where if a story is big enough it will bubble up naturally for me on social media or in Inoreader. The log4j vulnerability this week is a perfect example. I was slammed all day Friday. But, when I opened news I got up to speed on it real quick.

One thing is for sure, life needs to become a little more bearable in the next few weeks for a successful 2022.
