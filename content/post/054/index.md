We have been totally buried by snow this week in Michigan. The daily snow forecasts have been underestimated by inches almost everyday. Not a big deal, it's just a lot of powdery snow early in the winter. It'll probably be a white Christmas here in the Detroit metro area. Meanwhile, the job hunt is an odd mix of hot and cold. To be honest, I was hoping to have something pretty solid coming back from KubeCon. The fact that something hasn't happened yet I think can be firmly attributed to the time of year. No one wants to pull the trigger on hiring then go on vacation for the holidays. It's fine, my calendar this past week has been full of calls so I'm not worried, yet. In the back of my head though, doubt creeps in. I tweeted the other night, "[The worst part about job hunting is that it stokes the flames of imposter syndrome harder than any other venture could.](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/941519683525791744)" I found myself nitpicking job descriptions earlier in the week. I would find a single line that didn't apply to me and throw out the position. I caught myself Wednesday night and realized having been in hiring that no one checks every box. If they do you better throw bags of money at them because they will be getting bombarded by legit, good offers every week. Patience is hard, especially this time of year. But, thinking about it, this break has been pretty good for mentally recovering. It might eat away at self-confidence but that's probably a good thing from time to time. Mindfulness and perspective is key.

## Tools

[Adding Kubernetes support in the Docker platform](https://petty.company/products/kubernetes): When asked if Docker Swarm was dead, Solomon Hykes tweeted, "[Docker will continue to support both Kubernetes and Swarm as first-class citizens, and encourage cross-pollination. Openness and choice create a healthier ecosystem for everyone.](https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/941080802607222784)" My analysis: Docker Swarm, and likely Docker along with it, is quite dead. Swarm isn't fully baked and is quite far from it. The Docker Swarm product team will not be able to keep up with the Kubernetes community. Docker doesn't help companies run containers at scale better than Google. Docker doesn't build a better UI than the Kubernetes community. Docker has essentially given away everything and conceded to being a marginal consulting firm in the container space. Kubernetes just got boring and Docker (the company) just got put on life support. And yes, I recognize that this is probably punching down at this point.
