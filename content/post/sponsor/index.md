## Ad Format

Your ad will be featured *natively* in e-mails to all subcribers and on [devopsish.com](https://devopsish.com/). At special request, I can share your ad on social media. However, a limit exists of no more than three shares per week on a schedule that fits the needs of advertiser(s).

Ads include a bolded headline, additional copy, links as specified, and are followed by the italicized word, *SPONSORED*. This native format prevents ad blockers from blocking ads. It also eliminates a lot of headaches with regards to formatting. Total ad length excluding headline, call to action, and *SPONSORED* tag should not exceed 280 characters.

Ads appear in the section they make the most sense at the time of writing. If a specific location in the newsletter fits your ad, please let me know.

### Example Ad
