A trying week capped off by trigger point injections. Long story short, I've been trying to get a family out of Afghanistan for the past two weeks to no avail. I won't bore you with info or divulge identifying details. But, the possibility for their safe passage to the US has pretty much gone to 0. It's hard telling a 16-year-old kid that you've exhausted all your resources. You can only offer tidbits of info. HUGE shoutout to the team behind [Ehtesab](https://ehtesab.af/) for enabling me to get SOME intel from folks on the ground. The situation itself is a failure.

A failure on multiple levels. But, it's a stark reminder that you have to experiment and sometimes try all the ways possible to get a solution into production. Can you deploy this feature as a feature flag, or do you need a canary or blue/green deployment? At what layer are you going to manage THAT? Your global load balancer? Maybe inside your application stack on a `keepalived`  instance? Perhaps it's better to handle this in your Kubernetes cluster by managing replica sets or ingresses. Once you get past that decision, there are many more along the way. Then it's "go time." Your solution is ready to handle some production traffic.

You start seeing increased errors, so you roll back. This release isn't a failure, though. Maybe it's a bug somewhere else in the system. Maybe your environments aren't as consistent as you thought. Perhaps you're lacking a critical piece of information that somehow didn't make it to you (a recent change in the system like admission controllers being enabled in prod). This is why having a team that you can actively collaborate with is vital. You can do this in person or via Slack/Teams/etc. Regardless your peers might have seen behaviors like this before, and they know the answer. Better yet, the team rallies around the error and figures out your ingress isn't configured quite right (or you forgot a crucial new config). Remember the concept of [above the line and below the line](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3380777). You might have an excellent understanding of the abstractions but, maybe not that 20% use case people bump into.

The point is, test, validate, get peer reviews, and use your people network (internal or external) to the best of your ability. People are your greatest asset, no matter what part of the stack you're working on. People hold knowledge and capabilities. Never stop growing those networks. They will pay off at some point. Yes, soft skills matter more than your coding, configuration, and tests A LOT.

"In my last [blog](https://medium.com/@LachlanEvenson/how-to-enable-kubernetes-container-runtimedefault-seccomp-profile-for-all-workloads-6795624fcbcc), we learned about setting the RuntimeDefault flag in Kubernetes which configures all Pods to use a specific seccomp profile. While this is a great addition to improve your Kubernetes security posture, the runtime default seccomp profile might expose more syscalls than your application needs. In addition, the creation and management of seccomp profiles is cumbersome and error prone for cluster administrators. This is problem space is what the security profile operator sets out to solve. In this blog we‚Äôll cover the features of the [security profile operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator) and how to use it."
