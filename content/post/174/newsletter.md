"How to migrate depends, to an extent, on what you want to migrate from. The primary consideration is whether your existing infrastructure runs workloads in containers. If so, you're already off to a quick start because you won't have the containerization step to complete. Otherwise, you have a clear place to start."

"OpenShift virtualization enables Red Hat OpenShift clusters deployed to bare metal physical servers to use the KVM hypervisor to deploy and manage virtual machines utilizing Kubernetes APIs and Operators.  For applications which consist of a mix of containers and VMs, OpenShift virtualization provides a way to bring both components under the same management paradigm, allowing the application team to move at the speed of containers, but still retain the characteristics of a virtual machine when needed."

[Detailed Guide to Kubernetes Configurations - Download Today](https://devopsi.sh/guide-kubernetes-c346e)  
Accidental misconfiguration is one of the leading causes of security breaches. When it comes to Kubernetes, the configuration options are complicated, security features are not enabled by default, and most of the community is learning how to securely configure their infrastructure components. In this guide, StackRox takes a deep dive into key Kubernetes configurations and recommended best practices you should follow to secure your API server, kubelet, pod security policies, etc. - with code snippets to check the configs. *SPONSORED*
