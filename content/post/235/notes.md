## Notes

[(8) Emma Bostian üêû on Twitter: "When applying for a role in a U.S. company try to keep your resume to 1 page (2 max if you have 10+ years experience). A CV is a comprehensive overview of your work history. Resumes are preferred in the US and aren't comprehensive üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Anything on page 2+ probably won't be read." / Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmmaBostian/status/1437425438914142213)
