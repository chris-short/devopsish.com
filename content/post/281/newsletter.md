*Dear reader, please share this newsletter with a friend. Continued growth is a neccessary thing in the newsletter writing business. I am looking for ways to incentivize this without costing and arm and a leg.*

I read two articles this week that together make for an interesting economic problem. Pharmacists and others are stuck in the middle of wage stagnation and face overwhelmingly increasing demand for vaccinations, medicine shortages, and frustrated customers. A swath of people in the US (pharmacists in particular) [has seen decreasing wages while others have seen wage growth][1]. I've seen this first hand. In the US, most of our medical interactions are with pharmacists. Not nearly as much as in Europe, but if you have a medical condition, you see your pharmacist more often than doctors if everything is "manageable."

My CVS, where everyone used to know me by name, has had so much turnover lately that I could see the stress on the pharmacy's staff faces that I didn't recognize. "Hey Chris, I'll be right with you." a pharmacy tech that knows me said after helping someone in the store and approaching me from behind. There were two other people in line ahead of me, and the transaction times were gruelingly long. The amount of information communicated during the transactions was dense. This was mainly due to varying insurance policy coverage from plan to plan. The pharmacy had to explain to the customer before me that their old insurance has different coverages than their new insurance. That's something that is a citizen's responsibility here in the US.

These pharmacy techs' wage starts at $16/hour here in Michigan. By contrast, [the average for UAW union employees][2] (auto workers) here is $18/hour. Both jobs are complex, but the one with a direct customer-facing component is paid less.

The second article is about "[quiet quitting][3]" (it means work-life balance to most people) per the article, "Closing your laptop at 5 PM. Doing only your assigned tasks. Spending more time with family. These are just some of the common examples used to define the latest workplace trend of 'quiet quitting.'" I'm sorry, what?

I see "quiet quitting" in my day-to-day work. But it's not so much I'm unplugging to be wasting time. I'm unplugging to be a dad, husband, someone trying to make the world a little better, and get treatment for my disabilities. Without these responsibilities, I wouldn't have the drive I do during daylight hours. If a company is worried about "productivity," they are concerned about the wrong side of the problem. Instead of blaming "productivity" on this trend, pay people fairly and hire the correct number of people for the job to be done. Bringing everyone back into an office isn't a fix to supposed productivity problems; I'd think it'd exacerbate them. It will drive your best people to seek the kind of position they need for their lives. The work from home cat is out of the bag for many jobs now, thanks to the pandemic.

I'm incredibly calendar-driven due to the nature of my work. My demand grows higher daily, but I must set boundaries. As I tell Julie, "I could work 24 hours daily, but I wouldn't feel caught up." I've tried to be more flexible with a predominantly west coast-based team. But, during volleyball season, when Julie coaches high school girls three years younger than their competitors on how to win, I have to stop being an AWS employee and start being Chris Short, no matter what. I went to a home game last night (thankfully, the 5 PM meeting I had was rescheduled), and holy smokes, this is a second-year program, and they'll be ranked, no problem, if they can keep this up.

I see a few noteworthy things here. Based on Twitter interactions, quiet quitting is generally generational. One person's boundary setting is another person's "doing your job." But, with a large swath of people putting in that overtime on a salary, they'll see nothing for their extra efforts wage-wise, as mentioned in the first article. They'll likely have to change jobs to see an appreciable raise, as was the case before the pandemic. Meanwhile, another group of Americans has seen improved wages due to demand with an ever-increasing amount of employee empowerment as we work from home and manage our schedules based on our needs daily.

There will always be a group of folks that prefer to or have to go into the office (just like the inverse). Don't forget those of us who treat working from home as an accessibility issue (and were working from home long before the pandemic). The ergonomics in my custom spec'd office surpass anything any corporate office would willingly provide me. The lack of a commute helps me maximize time at work and home. If I start working at 5 AM because "I woke up with something on my mind" and stop working at 4:30 PM, I think I've put in a full day (even if I took a shower, got dressed, and took a 45-minute walk during the "work day"). Remember, there are a growing number of us in this boat too. We've invested thousands into making working from home work for five or more years during some of the most challenging years the world has seen of late.

Regardless, the economics behind this story is frustrating. The hard-working critical worker goes underpaid, while another group has seen the highest level of empowerment in decades. I'm not sure anything will change this either.

[Defensive Computing Checklist](https://defensivecomputingchecklist.com/)  
Michael Horowitz  
"People need a new perspective on computing. Much of the advice offered to the public is flatly wrong. Even when people mean well, they are often mis-informed or merely parroting back an accepted principal. Perhaps the most famous advice that turned out to be wrong, was the suggestion to periodically change your passwords. Ugh. Then too, advice from techies is often right for other techies, but wrong for the general public."

How might you re-architect your workflows when naive horizontal or vertical scaling reaches their respective limits?
