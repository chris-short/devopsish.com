The end of May looms large on the horizon and a busy June is ahead for a lot of us. This is about that time of year I wish it were the holiday season. It's hot, people's patience wears down faster, and there is always something to do. Here are some tips for the days ahead:

1. Remember to pace yourself; you don't have to live a full life every day.
2. Remember to be kind; you have no idea if the person standing next to you in line at the airport is going on vacation or to a funeral. This is why my typical response when interacting with folks in a customer service capacity is, "Thank you very much!" So rare is appreciation for their work shown directly to them. A little kindness goes a long way and the good news is, everyone has within them the capacity to have infinite kindness.
3. But, don't be a doormat, please. Also, if you're sweaty af don't hug me; it's June you filthy carbon-based life forms.

I'll be in Durham, NC 28-30 May and Raleigh 3-7 June. If you want to get together in the coming weeks, let me know. Stay safe out there and don't forget to drink water.

> [**DevOps'ish Summer 2019 Survey**](https://devopsi.sh/survey): Please take this year's survey. It is a handful of questions, will provide actionable feedback, and be greatly appreciated. The intent is to improve the overall experience and value this newsletter provides to its readers ([don't believe me?](https://devopsish.com/088/)). Thank you in advance, y'all!

ChromeOS axes key Intel CPU feature over data-leak flaws – Microsoft, Apple suggest snub](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/14/intel_hyper_threading_mitigations/) — I mentioned it earlier this week but, I'm legit thinking of switching to an ultra lightweight, 4 (actual) Core PC running Fedora because of the performance my 2018 MacBook Air has taken. There were shortcuts in keeping up with Moore's Law and our backs and wallets are going to pay the price for it. I'm open to suggestions for a new daily driver. But, it needs to comparable in weight to a MacBook Air (and not Huawei; more on that in next week's newsletter).
