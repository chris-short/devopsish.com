Our vacation in Yosemite National Park was amazing. Thanks for sticking around. I jumped out of PTO into DevOpsDays Detroit 2019. It was a great event! My report is linked below. Other news, is that I'm gearing up for Max's birthday, a potential nerve stimulator, and  KubeCon. If you haven't gotten your tickets and travel for KubeCon sorted yet, do so sooner rather than later (KubeCon discount code below). Happy DevOps'ing out there this week, y'all!

[Hey AWS - it's time to pay OSS developers](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2019/10/23/hey-aws---its-time-to-pay-oss-developers/) — "AWS could transform open source with a single feature. Why won't they do it?"

[Why Republicans Storming a SCIF Puts National Security at Risk](https://www.wired.com/story/republicans-storm-scif-national-security-nightmare/) — To be honest, this is WAY worse than an email server. There were pictures taken from a SCIF and shared online as well as multiple cellular devices in a room there should be *NONE*. This is an infosec nightmare.

[Exclusive: White House cyber memo warns of new network risks](https://www.axios.com/scoop-cyber-memo-warns-of-new-risks-to-white-house-network-9aa19c6c-77a3-485b-919b-1dd9bd691514.html) — The fact the US government still uses the term "cyber" shows how bad things *really* are.

## Process

[JEDI contract goes to Microsoft, not Amazon after Trump expresses opposition to giving contract to Jeff Bezos's company](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/25/pentagon-awards-controversial-billion-cloud-computing-deal-microsoft-spurning-amazon/) — This is really the only way this was going to work after all the [Oracle shenanigans](https://chrisshort.net/use-the-force-larry-oracle-playing-politics-with-nations-defense/). I think Google and IBM are vying for quantum leadership (neither of them was in the final bidding). But, if a nation other than the US gets a major technological advantage in the next decade we can blame Oracle for it. I feel AWS had the best chance of giving the Department of Defense the platform it needed to unlock AI. Fitting that Oracle might actually end up ruining the world.
