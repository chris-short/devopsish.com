We don't talk about salaries in the US like people do in other countries. Apparently, we citizens of the United States are extremely conservative when it comes to this topic. I'd like to see that change in my lifetime.

I sat down and looked at my W-2 like I do every year. A number hit me out of the blue. It proved to me job hopping works (to a point). From my first job out of the military to now, I've increased my salary by 3X. I'm not trying to brag at all. It's a living testament that veterans are likely undervalued. Also, that they should take full advantage of their newfound job flexibility.

When you look at my resume, since 2011, I've held 12 different positions. Each one was a pay raise, status boost, morality alignment, or open source work alignment. Then there was a transition from carrying a pager to not carrying one anymore. I've been at Red Hat for two and a half years. Today, my job is the best job I've ever had (and that is saying a lot). But, the two positions before joining Red Hat were only six-month stints with very legitimate reasons for leaving both. But, before that, a year at a great company. It shows that people are willing to work for great companies that align with their morals and ethos. Red Hat is a fantastic tech company with a wonderful culture. Every move to get here was worth it. Because it finally put my value and compensation in sync. It has made up for the previous nine years of not being able to put as much in a college or retirement fund. But, now that's all possible.

I'm writing this for my veteran friends. If I had made it to the 20-year mark, I would have retired last year. They are the ones that need to hear this. Trust your gut. You made it here by doing that many times before. You know when you feel like you might be giving up too much for too little. Always be looking for new opportunities that align your multitude of hard skills with proper compensation. But, once you find that perfect place for you, **STAY PUT**. Do your thing in that company for a few years. Make your best work of your life. Show them you're worth more than what they're paying you in the process. But, always be looking for the next perfect thing for you. My measurement is impact or more so, what kind of impact I can make? Make sure you get paid in the process.

[The SSPL is Not an Open Source License](https://opensource.org/node/1099)  
"And the software commons are now poorer for it. The Elastic projects were offered under the Apache license. Outside contributors donated time and energy with the understanding that their work was going towards the greater good, the public software commons. Now, instead, their contributions are embedded in a proprietary product. If they want to enjoy the fruits of their own and their co-contributors‚Äô labor, they have to agree to a proprietary license or fork."
