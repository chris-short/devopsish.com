This week has been quite a blur. Working backward (literally and figuratively), we’re re-entering lockdown as a household again. A visit with my pain management doctor on Thursday in which he told me the hospital we both live near has seen COVID-19 admissions double this week pushed things very front of mind. A statement from our state’s governor on Wednesday put things into motion towards lockdown (which she can no longer mandate thanks to our state legislature passing a law preventing her from doing so). With lots of data in hand, we made the hard decision yesterday. I know the readers in European nations (and probably elsewhere) are probably wondering, “How weren’t you in lockdown sooner?!?” Well, there’s not a state-level or national-level mandate to do so. We’re flying blind here in the US, and each household has to make its own decision. This is why we’re in the situation we’re in (again). Max took it in stride, saying that he’d still be able to see his friends on Zoom with enthusiasm. Our kids are so resilient. But, I am concerned about the long term effects of all the tumult.

[Dan Kohn's memorial](https://www.gatheringus.com/memorial/dan-kohn/5732?locale=en_US&c=934) was also on Friday. I think Ian Coldwater sums it up nicely with [their tweet](https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1327442525909446656), “HOW ARE WE GOING TO KUBECON NEXT WEEK WITH NO DAN AND WITHOUT EACH OTHER IT JUST ISN’T RIGHT[.]” They’re right; this doesn’t feel right. But, we’re going to push forward because Dan would want us to. KubeCon is a part of the healing process. Dan won’t be the focus next week; the fruits of his labor will be. That feels right.

Even though we can’t network in person, we can network in the [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/), [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/), [DevOps'ish Telegram](https://t.me/devopsish), [OpenShift.tv](https://openshift.tv), and countless other places. Let’s build relationships through text, then video, and then finally, when the time is right, in person like we’re advancing through technology in the late 1990s, early 2000s again. We did this once as a world, lest we forget. We just weren’t stuck at home ALL the time.

And yes! Next week is [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2020](https://www.cncf.io/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2020/)! I will be trying to be in all possible locations to make myself available and useful as best I can be. I will admit, I’m not as far along in my planning of exactly what I’m doing next week as I should be. But, I know I’ll be helping with [OpenShift Commons Gathering](https://commons.openshift.org/gatherings/Kubecon_North_America_Virtual_OpenShift_Commons_Gathering_2020.html), including an MST-3000 style take with a couple of coworkers on a few of the sessions. We’ll also be doing [a ton of project-specific office hours](https://red.ht/streamcal) as well during KubeCon, so please jump into the ones that interest you most and ask those tough questions; we’ve got the experts assembled. More KubeCon prep help is in the newsletter.

People might say traces can be used anywhere, but let’s face it: you absolutely need them when you’re dealing with distributed systems and microservices. You probably don’t have them yet because instrumenting your apps to collect them will get you super table-flippy. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Until now.
