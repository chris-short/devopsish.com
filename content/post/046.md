Is DevOps dying? I've had this thought for a few weeks now. Since [DevOpsDays Detroit](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-detroit/welcome/) when Richard I. Cook, M.D. sat shaking his head at Gene Kim on stage in a panel discussion titled, "DevOps, Safety, And Lean". Like a concept twisted by bad marketing DevOps has become almost a cult. There are those that practice it religiously and others that cannot adhere to every tenet every moment of every day but do try to "DevOps". Site Reliability Engineering has gained significant ground. As have many other practices and ideas that if embraced would balance the future of information work. Those of us in DevOps often forget where we came from. Never doing a deploy while the sun is up, only on the lowest traffic period, and rarely completed within the allotted time slot. Damn near anything was better than those days. Let's not be too high and mighty about DevOps. We all should focus on making things better for everyone.

I'll be in Raleigh at All Things Open this week. If you're around definitely come say hello and get a DevOps'ish sticker. Also, come check out my [lightning talk on Tuesday](https://allthingsopen.org/lightning-talks-hosted-by-opensource-com/).
