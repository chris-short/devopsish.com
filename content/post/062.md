This was a very interesting week for me. I participated in a chronic pain treatment study at the Ann Arbor VA Hospital early Tuesday morning. The experience, while odd, went incredibly well. Today is the first day I have felt noticeable pain which is likely due to managing Max at my nephew's birthday date. If you know me, you know this is an incredible feat. On Thursday, I attended a brand new [Kubernetes Meetup in Downtown Detroit](https://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Kubernetes-Docker-all-things-Cloud-Native/). It was fabulous! Mack and Uzo have some great ideas and I hope to collaborate with them on a few ideas we came up with after the Meetup. The coming week will be nuts!

* Monday: Lunch in Royal Oak, MI
* Tuesday AM: Meeting in Ann Arbor, MI
* Wednesday: Meeting in Washington, D.C.
* Thursday: [Detroit Go Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DetroitGolang/) in Downtown Detroit
* Friday-Sunday AM: [Open Source 101](http://opensource101.com/raleigh/talks/avoiding-devops-pit-misery-tips-trenches/) in Raleigh, NC

If you're around any of these places or events please don't hesitate to stop me and say hello. Then I'll be speaking at [DevOpsDays Charlotte](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-charlotte/) the following week. DevOps the fuck up, y'all!

[12 emerging IT job titles with a bright future](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2017/11/12-emerging-it-job-titles-bright-future): If you would have asked me this time last year I would have told you "DevOps Engineer" is a legit title. But, I now know that is no longer the case. If you're creating a DevOps team within a larger engineering organization you are creating silos.

[The rise and fall of 18F](https://www.fedscoop.com/rise-fall-18f/): This is a sad truth I feared would happen in the wake of the downsizing of the federal government. I use the term downsizing in lieu of whatever it is the current administration is doing.

[Kolton Andrus On Designing and Deploying Internet Scale Services](https://www.meetup.com/papers-we-love-too/events/247656710/): The [CEO of Gremlin](https://twitter.com/KoltonAndrus) is speaking about the paper, "On Designing and Deploying Internet-Scale Services". If you're in SF on February 28th, I highly recommend checking this out.

My friend, [Tammy Butow](http://tammybutow.com/), also of Gremlin, will be speaking at the [Melbourne AWS User Group: Chaos Engineering Month](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/melbourne-aws-user-group-chaos-engineering-month-registration-43014538643) on February 28th as well. Tammy is one of my favorite speakers so if you're in Melbourne definitely signup to see this. If you're not familiar with Tammy she killed it at [GopherCon 2017](https://youtu.be/5doOcaMXx08) and the Australian government just hosted her for a talk on [Chaos Engineering](https://youtu.be/qHykK5pFRW4).
