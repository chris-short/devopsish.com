I had a good but busy week. Two big things happened on Friday:

1. Max finished Kindergarten (super proud)
1. I reviewed more KubeCon CFPs for more people submitting them than I have in a LONG time

Three straight hours of non-stop CFP reviewing. Don't take this as a brag. I tend to put incoming requests for help over my work when so many folks ask for reviews of their CFP. That's okay. I appreciate being able to share knowledge and help wherever I can whenever the time is right. I might have been happier building out a GitOps environment for demoing during booth duty at [Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) (yes, I'm making an exception for Austin, TX). I will find out which was more fun next week.

It's always interesting to me working with first-time submitters. You're not putting together a business proposal. You're trying to get on stage at a conference with a talk acceptance rate in the teens. Remember that the conference CFP reviewers have a FAR more demanding job than I do. I try to improve the proposals I see (I don't rewrite them to get accepted magically).

The track chairs have to review scores and build their track to make it the best possible (reviewers sometimes have to defend their scores). It's a laborious and time-consuming process. If your talk isn't selected, you're in the vast majority. Please don't complain and especially don't be rude. That's a surefire way to make sure your talks are never accepted. Trust me. I'll be looking for negative comments toward KubeCon volunteers. Please don't do it. Your *career* will appreciate it.

There is a balance between being overly descriptive and not being descriptive enough in a talk proposal. A wall of text in front of someone who wants to review over 100 CFPs will get glossed over at best. There is a lot of pressure to get as many CFPs reviewed as humanly possible. The review process is cumbersome too. As someone proposing a talk, you'll have a better chance if you can [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) yourself into a tighter, cleaner CFP. I always love it when folks push back on my feedback too. I told one person never to assume the reviewer knows that the project your talk is about is on the CNCF Landscape. There are 1,097 projects on the [CNCF
Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/). No one knows them all by heart, and adding more work to a reviewer's plate will reduce your chances of selection. Ultimately, it's really on the submitter if
the talk is good enough. There's not much I can do other than positioning your proposal in a better light. If it's a turd of a talk or a glut of submissions about a particular project, your talk has an even higher chance of not being selected. If your talk isn't selected, look at the abstract of the talks on the schedule. Notice anything different? There's a wealth of knowledge lingering in past KubeCon schedules.

Let's do some math. [Observability](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?category=observability-and-analysis&grouping=category) has 129 projects in the CNCF Landscape. If you're up against 20 submissions about the same tool doing close to the same thing, your chances are now 1 in 20 of being selected. If you're keeping score at home, that is a 5% chance vs. an average of under 15%. That means your proposed talk has to be the best one. This happens more often than you think. You'll have to prove that your talk is the best on stage in [Detroit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/).

Speaking of Detroit, I had a conversation on Friday (I had a hectic week, and Friday was insanely busy). Someone asked for tips and hints about improving Detroit's image, so folks aren't complaining about going to Detroit for KubeCon. Y'all, Detroit is dope. Does it have major metropolitan area problems? Yes. Like the 26 cities in the US larger than Detroit, we have crime.

But, we also have [the best pizza in the US](https://www.buddyspizza.com/) and one of the [best
food scenes](https://visitdetroit.com/inside-the-d/detroit-restaurants-guide/) in the Midwest (probably only surpassed by Chicago). More importantly, my home is here. I could live anywhere, globally, and I chose Detroit over my original home state, North Carolina. Speaking of North Carolina, some of the best barbecue I've ever had is in the Detroit Metro Area.

I got some news if you think we don't know much about automation up here. Folks in Detroit build the robots that make people's cars in the US. We have one of the first [autonomous corridors](https://www.wxyz.com/money/auto-news/new-autonomous-vehicle-corridor-planned-between-detroit-and-ann-arbor) in the US connecting two cities where public/private research teams can test their new tech (like [in-road charging](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/electreon-detroit-wireless-electric-vehicle-charging/)). We have an entire section of Michigan (I live in it) called [Automation Alley](https://www.automationalley.com/).

If you're worried about Detroit, please talk to me. I will make you look forward to the visit, I promise. Downtown Detroit is one of my favorite places on earth. [Say nice things about Detroit](https://www.shinola.com/our-stories/say-nice-things-about-detroit-story-emily-t-gail/).

### [Take the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Survey](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/take-the-2022-state-of-devops-survey)

Each year the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#reports) team seek input from technical practitioners in every industry to help all of us understand the practices and capabilities the drive software delivery and operations performance. The research and subsequent reporting are anonymous, academically-rigorous, and platform-agnostic. The research investigates technical, process, measurement, and cultural capabilities. Anyone responsible for prioritizing, building, deploying, or operating software services is encouraged to participate in the survey.

## Events

[**ArgoCon**](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/argocon/)

SEPTEMBER 19 – 21, 2022

ArgoCon is designed to foster collaboration, discussion, and knowledge sharing on the Argo Project, which consists of four projects: Argo CD, Argo Workflows, Argo Rollouts, and Argo Events. This event is aimed at audiences that are new to Argo as well as providing depth to those currently using Argo within their organization. Connect with others that are passionate about Argo and interact with project maintainers. Learn from practitioners about pitfalls to avoid and best practices on how to adopt Argo in your cloud native environment. Get inspired by and provide input to Argo leads on project roadmaps.

[**SCALE 19x**](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/)
