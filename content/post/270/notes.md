## Notes

[**Take the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Survey**](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/take-the-2022-state-of-devops-survey)  
The State of DevOps report by Google Cloud and the DORA research team is the largest and longest running research of its kind with inputs from over 32,000 professionals worldwide. Without it, we wouldn't have gotten my most referenced book of all time, Accelerate. [Take the survey today!](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2aXfK0Zw75lvCl0?source=devopsish)
