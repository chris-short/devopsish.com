The right to refuse sponsorship from anyone for any reason is reserved.

Sponsors may not place restrictions on the content or format of the newsletter in any way.

Exclusive sponsorship deals are not available at this time. But, no more than three ads a week will run in the newsletter. Out of cycle/cadence e-mails may or may not feature ads depending on a variety of factors.

The newsletter is typically sent on Sundays at 0700 UTC. There may be weeks where due to travel or timezone differences the newsletter is sent a day earlier or a day later but this is the exception not the rule.

Rates can change based on supply, demand, and subscribership. Rates should not change more than once a quarter or four times a year.
