[The 2020 Last Week in AWS Charity T-Shirt: Route53](https://www.customink.com/fundraising/route53?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=190)  
I always love it when people ask if I know Corey Quinn. Yes, we're friends on two different sides of the country (we have the technology, it is possible). [Our kids played piano together](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1186319925901586432) last year on our family trip to San Francisco and Yosemite. I bought Max the [San Francisco LEGO set](https://amzn.to/3oKpqT2) for his birthday this week because that trip made such an impact on him as a person. The Quinn Family played a huge part of that. Corey is on my incredibly short Christmas card list. When my friends are trying to do good in the world I like to highlight that. Please, buy a t-shirt, tack on an extra $10 if you can, and support an amazing cause in [**826 National**](https://826national.org/).

## Process

People might say traces can be used anywhere, but let’s face it: you absolutely need them when you’re dealing with distributed systems and microservices. You probably don’t have them yet because instrumenting your apps to collect them will get you super table-flippy. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Until now.

"For now, there's only one but very important consequence: independent analysis of a microcode patch that was impossible until now," Positive Technologies researcher Mark Ermolov said. "Now, researchers can see how Intel fixes one or another bug/vulnerability. And this is great. The encryption of microcode patches is a kind of security through obscurity."

"KubeLinter is a static analysis tool that checks Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts to ensure the applications represented in them adhere to best practices." StackRox also wrote [a blog post about kube-linter](https://www.stackrox.com/post/2020/10/introducing-kubelinter-an-open-source-linter-for-kubernetes/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=devopsish&utm_campaign=190). My take, this is a pretty big step forward for an organization who a year ago did not have an open source offering at all. I hope to see more companies releasing tools that make their engineers more productive in the cloud native security landscape. I'll be continuing to kick the tires on this as the week progresses.
