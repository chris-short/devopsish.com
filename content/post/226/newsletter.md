If you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort) you know I've had a hard time with stable internet this week. Co-workers asking about my absence, I appreciate you. Sorry, y'all, sometimes everything breaks at once. But then today I get this when working on something newsletter related.

Y'all... I can't. I can't. I can't.

{{< tweet 1413940994333102083 >}}

Then it got worse. I won't go into details but, let's just say it was the cherry on top of a shit week for tech but otherwise good week here at home.

[Don't Ban "Politics" at Work](https://hbr.org/2021/07/dont-ban-politics-at-work)  
Your politics is my everyday life. "With political polarization on the rise and companies gauging the risks of employees' internal political activism, some are opting to ban political speech at work entirely. The authors, experts in speaking up at work, explain the pitfalls of this approach and instead suggest asking a different question: How can we support employees and encourage them to handle difference, respect one another, listen, and learn? The answer, they suggest, requires four actions on the part of leaders: Building empathy and respect for others' views, inviting different perspectives into the leadership fold, accepting mistakes gracefully, and teaching people how to disagree."

[Stepsize: Engineers waste 1 day a week on technical debt](https://venturebeat.com/2021/07/07/stepsize-engineers-waste-1-day-a-week-on-technical-debt/)  
"The average engineer spends 6 hours per week — roughly one day — dealing with technical debt, according to the State of Technical Debt 2021 report from Stepsize, a developer of software development tools. The average time spent on overall maintenance work and legacy systems is 33% — of which more than 50% of the time is spent solely on technical debt. That is time the engineer is not working toward their key goals."

[Didi went public and then immediately got whacked off Chinese app stores by regulators](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/04/technology/china-didi-app-removed.html).
