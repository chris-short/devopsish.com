The ever shifting sands of newsletter writing, these are the days of your DevOps'ish... There are no paying [sponsors](https://devopsish.com/sponsor/) this week. That's not a problem but, it is a little discouraging. The best part about being a disabled veteran is that I have a funding source for this newsletter until I decide to stop. But, this newsletter does take a significant amount of effort, time, and energy. It's nice to be compensated for that. [DevOps'ish Sponsorships](https://devopsish.com/sponsor/) are affordable and available in one month increments. Send me a note with how long you want to sponsor and what you're looking to achieve with your sponsorship. We can be awesome together!

**Editor's Note**: The Short family is going on vacation. DevOps'ish 150 will likely be a 'best of' issue (or maybe a beautiful post card). If you have a preference or better idea, let me know!
