Editor's Note: The newsletter passed 3,900 subscribers this week. I'd love to end the month at 4,000 subscribers. If you don't mind, please ask your coworkers and folks on social media to [subscribe to DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/). Y'all are awesome!

The inevitable is *finally* happening this week. [Docker  gutted itself to stay alive](https://thenewstack.io/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/) by selling off the money-making bits of the business to Mirantis. Docker states it's because they have two distinct businesses and they can only focus on one. The Docker that everyone knew is now boiled down to Docker Desktop and Docker Hub. Docker is going to run that with $35 million in cash they got from Mirantis and whatever is left in the bank. In the process, 300 former Docker employees now work for Mirantis (that sucks, they had no say in that). The remaining 100 work for a business that did a 10:1 reverse stock split and revaluation. In essence, Docker sold the farm for peanuts. This also wipes out a lot of  value of whatever stock Docker employees were holding on to in hopes of cashing in someday. I feel really bad for the former and current Docker employees. This has to suck for them. With that in mind, if you're at Docker still and need help finding a better job, updating your resume, or need to figure out what to do next, hit me up.

The one shocking thing from this news is folks wondering what went wrong. [I tried to tell y'all](https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/). This is what happens when you take on VC money and don't make a profit. You have to exit, IPO, or implode under your own weight. Docker chose the latter for some reason (probably hubris). Keep in mind, [Microsoft wanted to acquire Docker for a rumored $4 billion](https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/sources-microsoft-tried-to-buy-docker-for-4b/2016/06/) back in 2016 making everyone with Docker stock rich but, Docker opted not to. Now Docker will continue on with no profits, [no Docker Swarm](https://www.mirantis.com/company/press-center/company-news/mirantis-acquires-docker-enterprise/), and what I imagine is an insanely high bill to run Docker Hub.

I've heard rumors about the old Docker's run rate. While those numbers are now different since the Mirantis unload, $35 million wouldn't have lasted the old Docker a year. Docker's plan now is to focus on developer tooling. It's not a big secret that reducing friction improves outcomes. Everyone is looking to improve developer experience. Tech giants likely see blood in the water after this week. They are coming for the rest of Docker's business. It's only a matter of time now.

We're working on the New Contributor Workshop together and wanted to welcome more veterans into the Kubernetes communities. Give it a listen and subscribe for more episodes like this.

[Chris Short on Kubernetes and Preview of KubeCon by L8ist Sh9y Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/user-410091210/chris-short-on-kubernetes-and-preview-of-kubecon) â€”Â This week's guest is Chris Short, Principal Technical Marketing Manager at Red Hat; CNCF Ambassador and Co-host PodCTL Podcast. This podcast also includes a discussion on event giveaways and too many socks. Also, literally the day we recorded this, Google announced their swag changes for KubeCon this year.

[Linux, containers, Kubernetes the standard for IT's next era: IBM CEO Ginni Rometty](https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/668544/linux-containers-kubernetes-new-standard-it-next-era-ibm-ceo-ginni-rometty/) â€”Â Ginny highlighted the path forward for enterprise IT for the few years. I get it, it's IBM so it should be taken with a grain of salt. But, the gravity IBM has cannot be ignored. If Ginny is saying it, then IBM customers are believing it.

[The Microsoft-owned GitHub is under pressure for its work with ICE, as employees resign and activists protest its biggest event of the year](https://www.businessinsider.com/github-employees-ice-contracts-protest-microsoft-2019-11) â€”Â Several folks have left GitHub over a $200,000 ICE contract. Sophia Haskins leaving GitHub was in last week's newsletter. [Alice Goldfuss left GitHub this week](https://twitter.com/alicegoldfuss/status/1194666475325231104) dealing GitHub another major talent blow. I will say one thing, no one blames GitHub employees with families to feed and bills to pay for staying at GitHub.

[Do You Give Employees a Reason to Feel Proud of What They Do?](https://hbr.org/2019/11/do-you-give-employees-a-reason-to-feel-proud-of-what-they-do) â€”Â According to Deming, pride in one's work is one of the most important things in reducing costs and improving quality.

[The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data](https://amzn.to/2XqekFl) â€”Â In *The Unicorn Project*, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer, and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals.

[Google Cloud Down: GCP Suffers "Major" Global Outage](https://www.cbronline.com/news/google-cloud-down) â€”Â A number of Google services were impacted for quite some time. The impact though is not as widespread as an S3 outage, thankfully.

[One man's mistake, missing backups and complete reboot: The tale of Europe's Galileo satellites going dark](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/08/galileo_satellites_outage/) â€”Â Remember the Galileo outage a while back? "While one key official has sought to blame a single individual for the system going dark, insiders warn that organizational chaos, excessive secrecy and some unusual self-regulation is as much to blame." Whoa.
