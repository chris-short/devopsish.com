It's great to be working again. It's refreshing to be figuring things out, collaborating with others in real-time, and keeping my skills sharp. This week I did a lot of the typical on-boarding stuff but, also needed to refresh my Ansible and Kubernetes basics. I practiced by working on a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. I'll talk more about this cluster elsewhere but, it's amazing how rusty some skills get after a month and a half of not really using them.

This week I will be in New York City for [DevOpsDays NYC](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-new-york-city/speakers/chris-short/). I'll be talking about [testing certificate chains with Go](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-new-york-city/program/chris-short/). If you are attending please don't hesitate to stop and say, "Hi!". I promise I won't bite and I probably will have some stickers to give away.
