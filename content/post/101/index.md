Self-care is important. It's been a stressful past two weeks for me. This morning, I find myself reaching out to friends talking about anxiety (clearly mine isn't being managed effectively). But, in the past two weeks, I've gone from uncontrollable pain to trigger point injection pain to soreness from coughing (weather). Finally, yesterday, I got some relief thanks to trying something different. But, I forgot to eat until 2 PM.

It's amazing how stress, anxiety, and pain can shut out all the other signals your brain is receiving. That's why the newsletter is delayed again this week. Yesterday, it became clear that I wasn't listening to my body due to the noise from all the other issues going on. At about 8:30, having already started the newsletter, I decided to relax. My body had finally found peace, so I let it rest. Take care of yourselves out there.

This is because gRPC is built on HTTP/2, and HTTP/2 is designed to have a single long-lived TCP connection, across which all requests are multiplexed—meaning multiple requests can be active on the same connection at any point in time."
