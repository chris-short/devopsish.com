For some of us, we need a break. Going at a break neck speed while stretched out mentally and physically is exhausting. I find myself needing a break from at least one of the things I do. Can't cut out my job; can't cut out the newsletter. I think until the new year, I'm going to take a break from open source contributions. Expect no open source work from me until 2022 (minus writing because I enjoy that).

[Log4j](/248/notes/#log4j) dominated the news this week. I was pulling nuggets in for KubeWeekly earlier this week and it literally felt like every other post was about Log4j. I have know lost count of how many CVEs there in Log4j. But, it's all impactful. Even if your in house systems aren't based around Java there is likely something in your enterprise that requires log4j and you need to make sure your vanquish this at multiple layers of the stack.

[Reducing e-waste: Could refurbished IT equipment be better than new?](https://www.wholegraindigital.com/blog/refurbished-it/)  
Greener IT means making use of what we have for longer periods of time. This is why I bought a used server for the house. This is also why I'd do it again if I needed one.

## Process

[A Log4J Vulnerability Has Set the Internet 'On Fire'](https://www.wired.com/story/log4j-flaw-hacking-internet/)  
Wired being ever so subtle. "The problem lies in Log4j, a ubiquitous, open source Apache logging framework that developers use to keep a record of activity within an application. Security responders are scrambling to patch the bug, which can be easily exploited to take control of vulnerable systems remotely. At the same time, hackers are actively scanning the internet for affected systems. Some have already developed tools that automatically attempt to exploit the bug, as well as worms that can spread independently from one vulnerable system to another under the right conditions."

[gRPC - Best Practices](https://kreya.app/blog/grpc-best-practices/)  
"Designing gRPC services is different from designing REST services, where the API contract (ex. OpenAPI) is often generated from the server implementation. With gRPC, it's the other way around. The API contract is first defined in protobuf, then the client and server stubs are generated from that API definition. In this section, we explain some of the best practices when designing gRPC APIs."
