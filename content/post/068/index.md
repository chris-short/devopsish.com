On Wednesday, Kelsey Hightower decided to [take the rest of the year off from public speaking](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/976528030440083456). I've had a relatively light speaking schedule compared to Kelsey the past two years. [I feel Kelsey's pain](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/976571348368674817). I've had people tell me to my face that my talks were bad. I've had people talk to me about how much they love a talk. Putting these talks together is not easy, folks. Coming up with an idea, getting feedback on the talk idea, writing a CFP, submitting the CFP, building an outline, and building slides. You haven't even traveled or presented yet! I just finished a slide deck that took me two weeks to make. It wasn't non-stop but making the slides is literally the hardest part for me. I commend Kelsey for doing what's right for him and I look forward to seeing him speak again when he's ready.
