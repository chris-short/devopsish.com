[Never wait for a staging environment again](https://releaseapp.io/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_content=title&utm_campaign=20210228) üë©‚Äçüíªüßë‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª  
Do you find that your engineers spend too much time creating and maintaining staging environments and yet, there never seems to be enough environments to go around? A shortage of environments is a top driver of low developer productivity and often impacts an engineering team's ability to ship features on time. With Release, you can get a full instance of your app with all of its services with every pull request. You'll never have to wait around for staging environments again. üí° [Get started now](https://releaseapp.io/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_content=get-started&utm_campaign=20210228) üí° *SPONSORED*

[I no longer answer customer support surveys](https://www.yesthatblog.com/post/0110-i-no-longer-answer-customer-support-surveys/)  
Those surveys aren't actually addressing the systemic problems of an organization. They are helping assign blame in a lot of cases.

[Facebook isn‚Äôt sorry for letting someone steal personal details of half a billion users](https://grahamcluley.com/facebook-isnt-sorry-for-letting-someone-steal-personal-details-of-half-a-billion-users/)  
"So I can assume that Facebook isn‚Äôt sorry. It doesn‚Äôt even say that it‚Äôs going to contact the half a billion users who have had their details leaked onto the internet ‚Äì not because of the users‚Äô own fault, but because of Facebook‚Äôs incompetence and lack of care."

[Update on git.php.net incident](https://externals.io/message/113981)  
* We no longer believe the git.php.net server has been compromised.  
* However, it is possible that the master.php.net user database leaked. master.php.net has been migrated to a new system main.php.net.  
* All php.net passwords have been reset. Go to https://main.php.net/forgot.php to set a new password.  
* git.php.net and svn.php.net are both read-only now, but will remain available for the time being.

[IBM creates a COBOL compiler ‚Äì for Linux on x86](https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/07/ibm_cobol_x86_linux/)  
This is going to do a lot but, it's going to bring COBOL folks to Linux and Linux folks can help jump into COBOL workflows. A step closer to DevOps'ing the mainframe. [ETL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/etl) for all could be interesting too.

[How to compare the performance of different HashiCorp Vault backends](https://blog.flant.com/comparing-hashicorp-vault-backends-performance/)  
"In our case, we ended up using Consul as the backend that handles our project‚Äôs loads most optimally. Moreover, it is recommended by Vault developers. Its maintenance is still associated with noticeable overhead, though. However, there can be no compromise when it comes to stability issues: you have to do whatever you can to ensure that your configuration meets business requirements."
