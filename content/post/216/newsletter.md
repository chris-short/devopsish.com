[The Fear Black Employees Carry](https://hbr.org/2021/04/the-fear-black-employees-carry)  
"The voices of racism and white supremacy are louder than ever, and Black employees — and customers, suppliers, and investors — are living with a primal, existential fear. It’s not hard to understand why: Those who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6 included middle-class, middle-aged accountants, doctors, lawyers, shop owners, and even CEOs, from blue states and red states. People have learned that racists are all around them — in their extended families, their neighborhoods, and even among their colleagues. CEOs and other leaders must recognize this problem and address it competently, because ignoring it is not only morally wrong, it’s also bad for business. The author recommends five actions: 1) Commit to listening; 2) Take meaningful action; 3) Reckon with the past, and change the future; 4) Dig deeply to understand your company’s discriminatory practices; and 5) Back up your ideals with real money."

[Lambda School Reaches Settlement with DFPI, Agreeing to End Deceptive Educational Financing Practices](https://dfpi.ca.gov/2021/04/26/lambda-school-reaches-settlement-with-dfpi-agreeing-to-end-deceptive-educational-financing-practices/)  
"As part of the settlement Lambda will (1) notify students that the bankruptcy dischargeability provision language is not accurate; (2) retain a third party to review the terms of the school’s finance contract to ensure that it complies with all applicable laws; and (3) undergo a review of its marketing materials to ensure that the information is accurate and not likely to mislead consumers. The settlement is the result of a DFPI investigation that found that Lambda was engaged in conduct that violated the new law." Remember, under promise, over deliver; not the other way around.

[A third of Basecamp’s workers resign after a ban on talking politics.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/basecamp-politics-ban-resignations.html)  
Showing your privilege blows your whole shit up and doubling down on it again and again lands you in the New York Times for all the wrong reasons. This could have all been avoided by asking three outsiders what it'd do to their 57 person company. Well, they'll attract what these polices breed. Basecamp isn't a place I'd recommend folks work after the utter shenanigans this week. It wasn't really before but, now it definitely isn't.
