Last week, there was a giveaway of [Cloud Native Infrastructure](http://www.cnibook.info/) by Justin Garrison and Kris Nova. There's no need for a giveaway because you can now get [Cloud Native Infrastructure FOR FREE!](https://thecodeteam.com/cloud-native-infrastructure-e-book/) This week's edition is delayed due to [adventures](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/939474244152512512) [traveling](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/939526934421295104) back from Kubecon (salute to those that stood up [SIG-Airport](https://twitter.com/castrojo/status/939527794257813504)). I have to say that Kubecon had some of the friendliest people I've met attending, sponsoring, and running it. The hallway track was where I spent the vast majority of my time (also on the phone doing interviews). Brace yourselves for all things Cloud Native and Kubernetes.
