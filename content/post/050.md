And so it begins... The long road to decompression and the end of my burnout. As I mentioned on my blog on Monday, I am [**Leaving Bankrate**](https://chrisshort.net/leaving-bankrate/). It was not an easy decision to make but it was a move that needed to happen. I am considering writing a postmortem for the whole ordeal. I'm not sure I'll ever publish it. But, it is something many others could benefit from. This morning I woke up at 6:30 AM not quite knowing what to do with myself. On a normal morning, I would immediately check Slack, e-mail, PagerDuty, and iMessage as there would be something waiting for me to act on. When I went to shower this morning I grabbed my phone out of instinct, because someone was going to call me from work, right? Nope. It was nice to grab my phone so I could shower and listen to music without worrying about someone calling or a page coming in. Bankrate rewired my brain from proactive to reactive in a way I thought I had trained myself out of years ago. What's next? There are some things in the works. I will announce whatever my next steps are when the time is right. But, now is not that time. Stay tuned...
