I had a crazy day. I flew on a freaking plane! 2300 miles no less! I'm in Los Angeles, California for [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/). Keep your eyes peeled on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/) for the most up to date shenanigans. I already have a travel tip in the books for [folks ride sharing from LAX](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1446961447976661000).

Also, I [announced my resignation this week from Red Hat](https://youtu.be/VLoeHoL0HdE?t=1306). It has been an amazing three years. I finally figured out what I'm good at. Turning nothing into something. What I'm most known for at Red Hat is live streaming. But, that was something that became a massive conduit of information and knowledge sharing. The team had a challenge, we needed a solution. I was the right person, with the right gear, at the right time. Sometimes, things just work out like that.

One thing I've learned over the years, is that a great job has three components: the people, the work, and the location. Well... I got to pick the location. I should probably come up with something new for that one. The people were great. The work became was great. But, then it became a grind. A hard one too because there were so many unitegratable parts and pieces to the puzzle (an IFTTT for streamers is still a great product idea). We learned [you can make millions on Twitch](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/06/twitch-hack-pay-xqc-pokimane-summit1g/) this week. But, Red Hat was not getting money from streaming (which in light of the Twitch hack seems like a fault in our model potentially ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”).

Much like live streaming fell neatly in my lap, a new opportunity fell in my lap as well.[OpenShift.tv](https://openshift.tv), as I'll fondly remember, grew to something that graduated and I feel could be handed off. But, there is no magical Chris Short part duex waiting in the wings. The one thing the job was doing was increasing my burn rate to an unsustainable trajectory. The feedback was heard and the channel is being more decentralized. I think that's a good thing for everyone. There's a standard way to do it, documented, automated to the furthest reasonable extent, and folks can do it. Believe me, if I can do it multiple times a day with minimal dumpster fires, others can too.

Monday, after KubeCon, I'm shipping everything back to Red Hat. I'm going to take a few days off to hang out a little more with Max. Then start the next adventure. You'll still see me in the cloud native ecosystem. I'm not going too far.

Please understand that I am overwhelmed by the response and if you don't/haven't hear/heard from me directly. Please understand that I am deeply appreciative but, also only human.

[LANTENNA: Exfiltrating Data from Air-Gapped Networks via Ethernet Cables](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00104.pdf)  
"In this paper we present LANTENNA - a new type of electromagnetic attack allowing adversaries to leak sensitive data from isolated, air-gapped networks. Malicious code in airgapped computers gathers sensitive data and then encodes it over radio waves emanating from the Ethernet cables, using them as antennas. A nearby receiving device can intercept the signals wirelessly, decode the data, and send it to the attacker."

While Kubernetes was initially designed for stateless workloads, the community has made major strides in supporting stateful workloads. Today, we are excited to announce DoKC first research report about the state of data on Kubernetes!"
