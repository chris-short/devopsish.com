This week I finished a project that has been in the works for a quite some time. Back before I moved to Detroit but shortly after taking over [Triangle DevOps](https://tridevops.com/), I was offered (and accepted) a spot as a [DevOpsDays Raleigh](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-raleigh/welcome/) organizer. I submitted three talks to the event and one was accepted. Today I opened the event with my talk, "[The Dark Side of DevOps](https://speakerdeck.com/chrisshort/the-dark-side-of-devops)" and thoroughly enjoyed it as well as all the other talks at the event. Huge shout out to the other organizers, volunteers, and speakers for all their hard work in making the second DevOpsDays Raleigh better than the first one. It was great to catch up with friends while I was in town. Back to Detroit for me but what a week for news in general and DevOps!

## Process

[The hackers who broke into Equifax exploited a flaw in open-source server software](https://qz.com/1073221/the-hackers-who-broke-into-equifax-exploited-a-nine-year-old-security-flaw/)

[Solaris to Linux Migration 2017](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-09-05/solaris-to-linux-2017.html): Many people have contacted [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/index.html) recently about switching from Solaris (or illumos) to Linux, especially since most of the Solaris kernel team were [let go](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/04/oracle_layoffs_solaris_sparc_teams/) this year.

[Move Your Bugs to the Left](http://samwho.co.uk/blog/2017/09/06/move-your-bugs-to-the-left/): We all want to ship bug-free software. No-one wants to be the person that introduced a show-stopping bug the week before release.

[Monitoring and Observability](https://medium.com/@copyconstruct/monitoring-and-observability-8417d1952e1c) by Cindy Sridharan: What is the difference between "monitoring" and "observability", if any? Or is the latter just the latest buzzword on the block, to be flogged and shoved down our throats until it has been milked for all its worth?

[Debugging netlink requests](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/03/debugging-netlink-requests/) and [Finding out if/why a server is dropping packets](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/05/finding-out-where-packets-are-being-dropped/) by Julia Evans

[In Search of a Secure Time Source](https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/890-In-Search-of-a-Secure-Time-Source.html): All our computers and smartphones have an internal clock and need to know the current time. As configuring the time manually is annoying it's common to set the time via Internet services. What tends to get forgotten is that a reasonably accurate clock is often a crucial part of security features like certificate lifetimes or features with [expiration times like HSTS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLhb4jZuv6M). Thus the timesetting should be secure — but usually it isn't.

[Systemd on Ubuntu 16.04 can't (or won't) reliably reboot your server](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/SystemdUbuntuRebootFailure): On some servers, usually the busiest and most important ones, the system will just stop during the shutdown process and sit there. And sit there. And sit there.
