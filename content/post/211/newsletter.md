Well, what‚Äôs it like living in the last throes of the Free Software Foundation (FSF)? Many companies came out against the FSF's recent decision to re-add [he who was mentioned in DevOps'ish 145](https://devopsish.com/145/). [Red Hat probably gave the most scathing repudiation](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-statement-about-richard-stallmans-return-free-software-foundation-board). I can think of no worse strategy than bringing back someone who for so long abused, criticized, belittled, harassed, and bullied the people (especially women) around them. I used to support FSF and only did so after [he who was mentioned in DevOps'ish 145](https://devopsish.com/145/) ([droves of others are denouncing the decision too](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/03/free-software-advocates-seek-removal-of-richard-stallman-and-entire-fsf-board/)).

It's truly rare that I reassess my automated donations and think about where I'm donating money. I'm glad this utterly insane event sparked this reevaluation for me. Now that [he who was mentioned in DevOps'ish 145](https://devopsish.com/145/) is back at the FSF, [I put out a call on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1374110058016092168) for suggested charities or foundations I could support. Folks came through.

I've not only found a better place to send money than FSF, but I also added more causes in the process. I try to live life as transparently as possible. I do list what [Causes I support](https://chrisshort.net/causes/) on my website. I'm happy to say that I added the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and [/dev/color](https://www.devcolor.org/) this week. I probably should have been supporting Outreachy long ago but, it's better late than never. There are probably many other places I could be putting money to foster a more inclusive tech sector. If you, dear reader, have suggestions about which non-profits I should be engaged with, please hit reply and let me know.

**Editor's Note**: Another newsletter I contribute to ([KubeWeekly](https://kubeweekly.io/)) recently toyed with the idea of a section for videos, streams, podcasts, etc. I am wondering what you would think about a section specifically for Audio and Video content on DevOps'ish.

"The email, sent from Google‚Äôs Legal Investigations Support team, notified the recipient that Google may hand over personal information to DHS unless it receives within seven days a copy of a court-stamped motion to quash the request.

"It‚Äôs no surprise that many of us overload our workday, assuming we can take on many tasks in a small amount of time. Yet, at the end of the day, we‚Äôre stunned to find that work remains unfinished. Despite past evidence, our predictive engines gum up, and we‚Äôre convinced we‚Äôll be able to achieve the extraordinary in an ordinary day. This is called ‚Äúmagical thinking,‚Äù and it can cause you to disappoint others, miss deadlines, feel depleted, and lose your inspiration. But you can break free of this habit."
