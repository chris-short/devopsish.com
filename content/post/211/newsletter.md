Well, whatâ€™s it like living in the last throes of the Free Software Foundation (FSF)? I can think of no worse strategy than bringing back someone who for so long abused, criticized, belittled, harassed, and bullied the people (especially women) around them. I used to support FSF and only did so after [he who was mentioned in DevOps'ish 145](https://devopsish.com/145/).

It's truly rare that I reassess my automated donations and think about where I'm donating money. I'm glad this utterly insane event sparked this reevaluation for me. Now that [he who was mentioned in DevOps'ish 145](https://devopsish.com/145/) is back at the FSF, [I put out a call on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1374110058016092168) for suggested charities or foundations I could support. Folks came through.

I've not only found a better place to send money than FSF, but I also added more causes in the process. I try to live life as transparently as possible. I do list what [Causes I support](https://chrisshort.net/causes/) on my website. I'm happy to say that I added the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/), [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/), and [/dev/color](https://www.devcolor.org/) this week. I probably should have been supporting Outreachy long ago but, it's better late than never. There are probably many other places I could be putting money to foster a more inclusive tech sector. If you, dear reader, have suggestions about which non-profits I should be engaged with, please hit reply and let me know.

**Editor's Note**: Another newsletter I contribute to ([KubeWeekly](https://kubeweekly.io/)) recently toyed with the idea of a section for videos, streams, podcasts, etc. I am wondering what you would think about a section specifically for Audio and Video content on DevOps'ish.
