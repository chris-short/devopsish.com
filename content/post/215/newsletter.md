Two weeks before KubeCon EU and the work is ramping up quickly. If you haven't gotten your tickets yet, grab yours today. As always, if you are underrepresented in tech and still need a ticket, let me know. I will be busy next week prepping for a flip to Central European Summer Time with a lot going on. On May 3rd, I will be mc'ing [**GitOps Con**](https://kccnceu2021.sched.com/event/iZx4/gitops-con-hosted-by-weaveworks-redhat-complimentary-registration-required?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no). It's going to be awesome. On May 4th, the first anniversary of [OpenShift.tv](https://openshift.tv/) (yeah, it's been a year, y'all), I'll be live streaming [OpenShift Commons Gathering hosted by Red Hat (Complimentary Registration Required)](https://kccnceu2021.sched.com/event/iE1J/openshift-commons-gathering-hosted-by-red-hat-complimentary-registration-required). I'll be in the Red Hat booth for a little bit on May 5th. We'll also be streaming open source project Office Hours throughout KubeCon EU. Finally, on Friday, I'll be doing my first ever, actual KubeCon talk (I know, weird, right?), [How You Can Tell Your Kubernetes Contributor Story with These Tips - Matt Broberg & Chris Short, Red Hat; Kaslin Fields, Google; Peeyush Gupta, DigitalOcean](https://kccnceu2021.sched.com/event/iE6I/how-you-can-tell-your-kubernetes-contributor-story-with-these-tips-matt-broberg-chris-short-red-hat-kaslin-fields-google-peeyush-gupta-digitalocean). To say the prep for all this is coming to a head this week is an understatement. The pressure is on. Let's get it!
