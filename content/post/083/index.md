It was a holiday week here in the United States. On Wednesday, we celebrated our independence. It is rather fitting that the DevOps'ish newsletter blasted past *1776* subscribers this week (the year the US declared Independence). After eighty-three weeks of doing this newsletter, I would like your help in improving it. I've put together [a quick sixteen question survey](http://devopsi.sh/survey) that will ultimately improve the format and content in DevOps'ish. The data from the [**DevOps'ish Summer 2018 Survey**](http://devopsi.sh/survey) will be a vital measurement to guide the direction of the newsletter going forward. No personally identifiable information is necessary to complete the survey. Please take a few minutes and let me know what you like or don't like about **DevOps'ish**.
