"DST was implemented in 2010... to give more time after work to tend to their plantations, promote public health, and save fuel. Instead it defeated its own goals by being used by people to socialize more”

[EU proposes mandatory USB-C on all devices, including iPhones](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones)  
"The rules are intended to cut down on electronic waste by allowing people to re-use existing chargers and cables when they buy new devices." This will separate the buying of a charger from the buying of a device. And it's USB-C too which has its own set of problems.

[Linux Foundation survey shows companies desperate to hire open-source talent](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-foundation-survey-shows-companies-desperate-to-hire-open-source-talent/)

[How Paul Osman thinks about long-term strategies, open telemetry, and the value of boring systems](https://www.opslevel.com/blog/opslevel-convos-paul-osman/)  
"'OpenTelemetry is one of those great stories in open source– two communities recognized that they were serving the same audience and then decided to combine their efforts,' said Osman. 'OpenTelemetry specifically grew out of two different projects with very similar goals, which were to create an open-source ecosystem around telemetry data, specifically, tracing, metrics, and logs.'"

"TL;DR: Linux has been supporting Full Disk Encryption (FDE) and technologies such as UEFI SecureBoot and TPMs for a long time. However, the way they are set up by most distributions is not as secure as they should be, and in some ways quite frankly weird. In fact, right now, your data is probably more secure if stored on current ChromeOS, Android, Windows or MacOS devices, than it is on typical Linux distributions."
