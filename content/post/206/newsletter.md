Sometimes you don't know what the world needs until someone tells you. On Monday this week, a friend asked if I had any additional books to point them to for Kubernetes help. I have a mile-long list in my head. I said, yeah, let me punch that up for you real quick. But, instead of creating a locked down doc or dust bin email, I built a website. Behold, [**Kubernetes README**](https://kubernetesreadme.com/). It's nothing really fancy. A copy of an existing site, with a different name, and data to help folks make a selection that fits their needs.

But, this is the beauty of working in an open source environment. I didn't even think of typing them an email. It was going to be a website the second the ask came in. There was no reason to go to the effort of creating a list of books that would live in a vacuum. Sharing knowledge helps us all. It's how folks can figure out how to grow on their own. Thanks for the idea, Justin. I hope it helps.

Please note, the [DevOps‚Äôish Solarwinds supply chain compromise Index](https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/) has many updates this week. Including a White House briefing on the matter.

[Why did I leave Google or, why did I stay so long?](https://paygo.media/p/25171)  
"So the question of why I stayed has many different aspects to it. When we were evaluating the offers to sell the company, we asked ourselves what would really change by being acquired? Due to a bunch of mistakes early on, we did not own substantial amounts of equity and had a pretty bad relationship with some of our board members. I remember the bottom line: ‚Äúwouldn't you rather work for Larry Page than our current board‚Äù? We were committed to our mission and saw this as a change in the cap table rather than a change of mission. This counted on the fact that Google had promised us autonomy to continue to act as Waze and we believed them."

[Kenya Is Becoming a Global Hub of FinTech Innovation](https://hbr.org/2021/02/kenya-is-becoming-a-global-hub-of-fintech-innovation)  
"For more than half a century, the U.S. was the center of global innovation for financial technology, inventing credit cards, ATMs, and online banking. Now, however, it‚Äôs falling behind, as China has become a leader of mobile payments, and now African countries ‚Äî namely Kenya ‚Äî are making huge strides with familiar technologies such as mobile phones and SMS-style messaging, and rapidly expanding the circle of financial inclusion. Companies can learn three important lessons from this most recent wave of innovation: bundling services (think: banking and cellular as one offering) is essential to success; finance is about trust, but trusted companies can lend their credibility to newcomers with promising offerings; and technology that enables mass adoption or expansion is often old, not cutting edge."

[This Cloud Computing Billing Expert Is Very Funny. Seriously.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/technology/corey-quinn-amazon-aws.html)  
It's weird and cool when people you know are in the NYT. It's like, "What am I doing wrong?" mixed with "Really?!? Corey?!?" Regardless, Corey has put in the work and deserves as much praise as we can throw on him.

"Okay Google, what are we doing wrong with our AI team?" *DING* "Stop 'alienating Black women.'"

[Preparing to Issue 200 Million Certificates in 24 Hours](https://letsencrypt.org/2021/02/10/200m-certs-24hrs.html)  
"When we think about what essential infrastructure for the Internet needs to be prepared for though, we‚Äôre not thinking about normal days. We want to be prepared to respond as best we can to the most difficult situations that might arise. In some of the worst scenarios, we might want to re-issue all of our certificates in a 24 hour period in order to avoid widespread disruptions. That means being prepared to issue 200 million certificates in a day, something no publicly trusted CA has ever done."
