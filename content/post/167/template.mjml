          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>I got up this morning and was quickly exhausted from pain. I had noticed this exhausted feeling earlier in the week. It was the day of a doctor's appointment to get injections to fix the mentally distracting nature of constant, chronic pain. I discovered <a href="https://burnoutindex.org/">burnoutindex.org</a>, which is a nine-question test to give you an idea of your main risk factors of burnout. My two key elements are self-inefficacy and exhaustion (<a href="https://shortcdn.com/file/devopsish/Chris-Short-Global-IT-Burnout-Index.pdf">see my burnout report</a>). I've proven that this exhausted feeling is a real thing; what do I do about it? According to this, I need to figure out what my sources of energy are and bulk up on them while working to figure out what work-related urgencies are overwhelming. I think my problem is that I feel like I'm often trying to move a celestial body into or out of an orbit. The force, effort, time, and energy this requires is enormous. Of course, if you feel like the weight of the world is on you, exhaustion is a natural outcome. I have to remember that I'm sitting behind a keyboard and that I am only human. Hopefully, this too shall pass.</p>
          <p>Without further ado, let's get on with this week's newsletter. Tell me what you think. I'm nothing without feedback. Also, don't forget to support the sponsors.</p>

            A high level look at how infrastructure changes should occur as you scale. Note that splitting frontend and database is step one.</p>

            The SaaS model is going to open doors to funding things with debt as the value of the cash flow itself becomes the thing that people work to monetize. To some people, companies make money, not products. That perspective changes your view of the world.</p>

            Having infrastructure isn&rsquo;t good enough. Measuring, researching, and making improvements iteratively should always be a part of your life.</p>

            I&rsquo;m sure Corey Quinn will have smarter things to say about this. But, if you have enough infrastructure to host Netflix you can pretty much do away with CAP Theorem. Also, putting the database closer to the work being done helps.</p>
