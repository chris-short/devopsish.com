The past few weeks have resulted in iterative improvements to my office workspace. After visiting a few Red Hat offices, it dawned on me that my office wasn't what it should be. The improvements have helped me mentally in numerous ways. They've also allowed me to think more broadly about a number of things. Some odd little nuggets related to DevOps'ish popped out too (sausage making follows):

1. Automation: This newsletter relies more on automation for content curation than you might realize. Recently, I've realized I'd like to run that automation more reliably with more granular controls. A switch from IFTTT to Zapier took place after I couldn't determine why Corey Quinn's [Last Week in AWS](https://ref.lastweekinaws.com/7h1z3x) was breaking my automation. Corey's site was making a malformed URL. IFTTT gives little in the way of logging or event details compared to Zapier. So one evening this week I migrated everything.

2. The Return of the RSS Feed: A lot of my reading had moved away from RSS feeds after the death of Google Reader. But, the dust *finally* settled in that world I have embraced RSS again in a big way. Cleaning out IFTTT showed me how much my reliance on it to parse RSS and send me e-mails had become. All of those RSS feeds moved into my [inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/). Then it dawned on me, "This is hypocritical." I originally turned off the DevOps'ish RSS feed to get more people to subscribe to the e-mail newsletter. That 'gamble' paid off. There are now over 2,000 subscribers to DevOps'ish weekly e-mails. Not having an RSS might have helped reach that number a little faster. But, it's not open and focuses more on the business side of things and less on the user experience. Time for that to change.

3. Return of the Facebook: The blue F took a huge one to the chin in the face of Cambridge Analytica. Have they learned their lesson? Probably not. But, not having the Facebook page for DevOps'ish seemed silly. I re-enabled the Facebook page and invite you to [Like it if you're into Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/devopsish/).
