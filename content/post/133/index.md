## People

[The worst morale boosting gesture Iâ€™ve experienced](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2019/06/the-worst-morale-boosting-gesture-ive-experienced/) â€” This might be the single dumbest morale booster I've ever heard (and I've seen some really bad ones).

[When Your Job Is Your Identity, Professional Failure Hurts More](https://hbr.org/2019/06/how-we-confuse-our-roles-with-our-self) â€” "...when you take professional kicks personally you compromise your own ability to recover and see the bigger picture..." Perhaps you are the one doing the kicking and your organization is reacting accordingly.

## Process

[TCP SACK PANIC](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/tcpsack) â€” Originally discovered by [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001.md), these TCP selective acknowledgment vulnerabilities impact Linux and FreeBSD kernels. "Multiple TCP-based remote denial of service vulnerabilities" (four CVEs in total) basically creating a new pings of death. Woohoo! Y'all exhausted from these mega vulns yet? [LWN](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/791409/d00105536e597c1c/) has a great overvieew.

[DevOps'ish Summer 2019 Survey](https://devopsi.sh/survey) is coming to a close. It's *vital* feedback that I will use to pivot, fork, or modify the newsletter, if needed. Therefore it's important that everyone [**takes the survey today**](https://devopsi.sh/survey)!

[Forget monoliths vs. microservices. Cognitive load is what matters](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters) â€” "Excessive cognitive load works against effective team ownership and supportability of software. Here's why, and how to approach the problem." FINALLY! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

[3 Strategies for implementing a microservices architecture](https://about.gitlab.com/2019/06/17/strategies-microservices-architecture/) â€” Three ways to attack that weighty monolith.

[VMware Eyeing Containers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4270923-vmware-eyeing-containers) â€” A Wall Street take on the goings on of VMware which is starting to look like a great destination if the future of Kubernetes is something you want to work on.

[Cisco and IBM Cloud Announce Hybrid Cloud Partnership](https://blogs.cisco.com/datacenter/cisco-and-ibm-cloud-announce-hybrid-cloud-partnership) â€” Enterprise vendors; holding hands and skipping through the hybrid clouds together.

[What is DevOps](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/) â€” "DevOps is the professional practice of frequent, continued, and iterative improvements through measurable changes, the goal of which is to become a high-velocity organization thus improving business outcomes."

## Tools

[Future of CRDs: Structural Schemas](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/06/20/crd-structural-schema/) â€” "The core of a structural schema is an OpenAPI v3 schema made out of `properties`, `items`, `additionalProperties`, `type`, `nullable`, `title`, and `descriptions`. In addition, all types must be non-empty, and in each sub-schema only one of `properties`, `additionalProperties` or `items` may be used."

[The future of how Ansible content is handled](https://youtu.be/CGjDarrqBjg) â€” Collections are coming and the Ansible team needs your feedback. Kick the tires and let us know!

[New C5 instance sizes and bare metal instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-new-c5-instance-sizes-and-bare-metal-instances/) â€” More compute for the compute gods.

[All You Need to Know About Red Hat Universal Base Image](http://crunchtools.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-red-hat-universal-base-image/) â€” If Twitter is any indication, there appears to be a lot of interest in Universal Base Image (UBI). I'm biased (Red Hat employee; see [disclaimer](https://devopsish.com/disclaimer/)) but, I think it's pretty slick. I had a very lean and secure [container for Alibaba Cloud's ossutil](https://quay.io/repository/chrisshort/ossutil) to use in CI  in no time. The trick is using [microdnf](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3144031) (free login required).
