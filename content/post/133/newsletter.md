Perhaps you are the one doing the kicking and your organization is reacting accordingly.

[DevOps'ish Telegram](https://t.me/devopsish) â€” Join the 300+ DevOps, Kubernetes, SRE, and other technology professionals discussing real-world problems, breaking technology events and outages, and the occasional Spotify playlist. [DevOps'ish Code of Conduct](https://github.com/chris-short/policies/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) applies.

## Process

[TCP SACK PANIC](https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/tcpsack) â€” Originally discovered by [Netflix](https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/third-party/2019-001.md), these TCP selective acknowledgment vulnerabilities impact Linux and FreeBSD kernels. "Multiple TCP-based remote denial of service vulnerabilities" (four CVEs in total) basically creating a new ping of death. Woohoo! Y'all exhausted from these mega vulns yet? [LWN](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/791409/d00105536e597c1c/) has a great overview.

[DevOps'ish Summer 2019 Survey](https://devopsi.sh/survey) is coming to a close. It's *vital* feedback that I will use to pivot, fork, or modify the newsletter, if needed. Therefore it's important that everyone [**takes the survey today**](https://devopsi.sh/survey)!

[Forget monoliths vs. microservices. Cognitive load is what matters](https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/forget-monoliths-vs-microservices-cognitive-load-what-matters) â€” "Excessive cognitive load works against effective team ownership and supportability of software. Here's why, and how to approach the problem." FINALLY! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯

[Explaining CVE-2019-10164 + PostgreSQL Security ~~Best~~ Practices](https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/explaining-cve-2019-10164-with-postgresql-security-best-practices) â€”Â I love how security issues in the PostgreSQL community are solved emphatically by upgrading to the latest version. I know that's not as cut and dry as it sounds but, think about that recommendation for MySQL or Oracle ðŸ˜±ðŸ™€ðŸ˜±ðŸ™€

[Understanding Public Key Infrastructure and X.509 Certificates](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/understanding-public-key-infrastructure-and-x509-certificates) â€” PKI basics are vital for almost everyone reading this. This will get you some CLI time with openssl.

[IBM to win unconditional EU okay for $34 billion Red Hat deal](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-red-hat-m-a-ibm-eu/ibm-to-win-unconditional-eu-okay-for-34-billion-red-hat-deal-sources-idUSKCN1TK28K) â€”Â Coupled with reports that [this is the last quarter Red Hat will be reporting earnings](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/06/21/red_hat_last_results_before_ibm_acquisition/), it would appear the end of an independent Red Hat is here. I'm optimistic about what the future brings! Note: both of these articles have been added to the [DevOps'ish IBM Red Hat Acquisition Index](https://devopsish.com/ibm-red-hat-acquisition-index/).

[VMware Eyeing Containers](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4270923-vmware-eyeing-containers) â€” A Wall Street take on the goings on of VMware which is starting to look like a great destination if the future of Kubernetes is something you want to work on.

[What is DevOps](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/) â€” "DevOps is the professional practice of frequent, continued, and iterative improvements through measurable changes, the goal of which is to become a high-velocity organization thus improving business outcomes."

## Tools

[Future of CRDs: Structural Schemas](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/06/20/crd-structural-schema/) â€” "The core of a structural schema is an OpenAPI v3 schema made out of `properties`, `items`, `additionalProperties`, `type`, `nullable`, `title`, and `descriptions`. In addition, all types must be non-empty, and in each sub-schema only one of `properties`, `additionalProperties` or `items` may be used."

[The future of how Ansible content is handled](https://youtu.be/CGjDarrqBjg) â€” Collections are coming and the Ansible team needs your feedback. Kick the tires and let us know!

I'm biased (Red Hat employee; see [disclaimer](https://devopsish.com/disclaimer/)) but, I think it's pretty slick. I made a very lean and secure [container for Alibaba Cloud's ossutil](https://quay.io/repository/chrisshort/ossutil) to use in CI in no time. The trick is using [microdnf](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3144031) (free login required).

Bold statement.

[Faster Docker builds with pipenv, poetry, or pip-tools](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pipenv-docker/) â€”Â If you're building python containers, these are some great suggestions.

[New C5 instance sizes and bare metal instances](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-new-c5-instance-sizes-and-bare-metal-instances/) â€” More compute for the compute gods.

[Introducing time.cloudflare.com](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-time/) â€”Â I'm a huge NTP nerd. The fact Cloudflare is offering this service is good. Quality time sources on the internet are drying up. The fact they took the extra step to provide a secure NTP service is good too. But, I would still use the [NTP Pool Project](https://www.ntppool.org/).

[You can now download the new Open Source Windows Terminal](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouCanNowDownloadTheNewOpenSourceWindowsTerminal.aspx)

[Getting wildcard SSL certificate in Kubernetes with cert-manager](https://medium.com/@Amet13/wildcard-k8s-4998173b16c8) â€”Â "[H]ow to get an SSL certificate with HTTP01 validation and a wildcard certificate with DNS01 validation on AWS"
