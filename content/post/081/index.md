I had a very quiet week (which explains the enormity of this week's newsletter). To give you an idea what the highlight of my week was, on Friday, I wiped two laptops, went to FedEx, and shipped them back to their owners. I'm spending the weekend between jobs resting and resetting. I will be in Raleigh the first part of the week and will finish the week at home, working for a new employer. To say I'm looking forward to getting started would be an understatement. I'm probably more excited to start this job than any other job I've ever had. Keep your eyes on [chrisshort.net](https://chrisshort.net/) for an announcement on Monday.
