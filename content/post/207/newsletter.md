DevOps'ish is in a state of spring cleaning. First, I've found a tool that I like more than Pocket to bookmark and save pages in [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish). All the Recommended Reads automation is now pulling from Raindrop.io. Then three Zapier rules ferry everything off to the appropriate places. I made that transition midweek.

Next is the newsletter service itself. I've been unhappy with the current provider ever since doing the never-easy switch from Mailchimp (how forward-thinking that was) to the current provider. I've had more tickets opened than newsletters sent; enough was enough. Last week, I discovered [**EmailOctopus**](https://emailoctopus.com/?urli=n6msM). I have been researching it in my spare time. Yesterday was a day off for me, so I started the switch to making DevOps'ish a Google Workplace domain and use EmailOctopus to send newsletters. It takes a lot more work than it should to get and send an email than it used to, but it'll be worth it.

The [DevOps'ish Solarwinds supply chain compromise Index](https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/) has many updates this week. Including the former Solarwinds CEO blaming an intern for the mistake and a congressional hearing on the matter.

[Give Black Employees Time to Rest and Recover](https://hbr.org/2021/02/give-black-employees-time-to-rest-and-recover)  
"Black employees have been navigating both the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 and systemic racism over the past year. Prioritizing recovery and resilience, both from an organizational and personal perspective, is vital. To do this, focus on four key areas: getting rest, learning to say “no,” making space for collective healing and care, and positively affirming Black identity."

[How to Avoid the Most Dangerous Word in Software Development](https://pawelurbanek.com/dangerous-word-slack)  
"J-U-S-T. Those four characters can be significantly detrimental to a software development process. In this blog post, I'll describe how the 'just keyword' can affect team's communication and how to avoid misusing it on Slack."

[Mailchimp employees have complained about inequality for years — is anyone listening?](https://www.theverge.com/22300931/mailchimp-company-culture-discrimination-unequal-pay?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4)  
And the [CEO admitted they have "work to do."](https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-ceo-ben-chestnut-email-pay-equity-discrimination-kelly-ellis-2021-2) That might be an understatement.

[Some quick thoughts on Citi's $900M OOPSie](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2021/02/19/some-quick-thoughts-on-citis-900m-oopsie/)  
"Citi accidentally transferred $900 million dollars to various hedge funds. Citi then asked the funds to reverse the mistaken transfer, and while some of the funds did, others said, 'no, it's ours, and we're keeping it,' and Citi took them to court, and lost." This story is wild. It's [a checkbox away from a disaster](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-17/citi-can-t-have-its-900-million-back) waiting to happen; which makes me wonder how it hasn't happened before.
