Welcome!

Your environment makes up so much of who your are in real life. I often wonder if your work environment reflects how your infrastructure will look. If you're okay with satisfying that 80% use case, does your infra look like AWS with hundreds of services some of which are quite stable and others not so much? Or if you the perfect be the enemy of the good and be like a lot of companies and spend a lot of time spinning their wheels waiting for the right thing to happen. I've seen countless examples of this.

But, what about when your environment is resilient, scalable, and cloud enabled. What about when psychological safety is achieved AND the idea of cost per minute to the business during an outage is established? We see so many examples of bad ways and maybe a few good ways of building . I would love to see more use cases around the things that are possible when the business value is known down to the individual and the organization is a high-performer. Highlighting more of the good, I hope, would engrain "the why" behind the need for change way more than features and individual capabilities.
