          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>The impact of the coronavirus hit the tech events industry hard this week. In a shocking move on Tuesday, <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/from-laura-baldwin.html">O&rsquo;Reilly announced it has immediately ceased all in-person events</a>. To add insult to injury, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshsimmons/status/1242596429924728832">O&rsquo;Reilly laid off their entire events staff during a pandemic</a>. To make matters worse, under US law, they&rsquo;ll get only a week of health insurance benefits left, <a href="https://twitter.com/jhscott/status/1242604187294154752">meager support for COBRA (super expensive health insurance), and any severance is based solely on tenure</a>. DevOps&rsquo;ish is an O&rsquo;Reilly community partner. I heard from the O&rsquo;Reilly partner team this week. I was slated to speak at the <a href="https://conferences.oreilly.com/infrastructure-ops/io-ca/public/schedule/speaker/200908">O&rsquo;Reilly Infrastructure &amp; Ops Conference in June</a>). I haven&rsquo;t heard a peep out of O&rsquo;Reilly either about what happens now. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/about/open-source-matters-more-than-ever.html">Tim O&rsquo;Reilly mustered up this &lsquo;lipstick on a pig&rsquo; post</a>, though, so we should all feel great about it, right? Guess what; I don&rsquo;t.</p>

            I took some of my notes and compared them with Gareth Rushgrove (Devops Weekly) and Mattias Geniar (cron.weekly) on what it&rsquo;s like writing a tech-related newsletter. It&rsquo;s very rewarding, but it is not trivial.</p>

            &ldquo;There are some resources listed on the web site, including organizations focused more widely on the problems that COVID-19 is bringing to our world (e.g. the World Health Organization response fund). There are also pointers to web pages covering virtual event organization and the mechanics of running an online event. The FOSS Responders web site makes it clear that many of the items posted there are simply meant as starting points; those with ideas are encouraged to get in touch with the project.&rdquo;</p>

            When using Amazon&rsquo;s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), you must understand which pieces of the security management role fall on you. AWS takes responsibility for securing their infrastructure and addressing security issues in their software. The customer must ensure the security of their own applications while correctly using the controls offered to protect their data and workloads. In this 42-page eBook, StackRox covers general EKS cluster security, including the standard controls and best practices for minimizing the risk around cluster workloads, as well as specific requirements for securing an EKS cluster and its associated infrastructure. <em>SPONSORED</em></p>

            &ldquo;A person whose personal data is being shed on Zoom doesn&rsquo;t know that&rsquo;s happening because Zoom doesn&rsquo;t tell them. There&rsquo;s no red light, like the one you see when a session is being recorded. If you were in a browser instead of an app, an extension such as Privacy Badger could tell you there are trackers sniffing your ass. And, if your browser is one that cares about privacy, such as Brave, Firefox or Safari, there&rsquo;s a good chance it would be blocking trackers as well. But in the Zoom app, you can&rsquo;t tell if or how your personal data is being harvested.&rdquo;</p>
