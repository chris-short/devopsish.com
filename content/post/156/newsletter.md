Editor's Note: The newsletter passed 4,000 subscribers this week. Thank you to everyone that help spread the word. I'd love to get to 5,000 subscribers as quickly as possible though. If you don't mind, please ask your coworkers, BFFs, family, and folks on social media to [subscribe to DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/). Y'all keep being awesome!

It is worth noting that the metrics-based system I use to help write DevOps’ish has broken. This week, I lost the ability to post to Twitter due to rate limiting of Tweets sent by IFTTT. Thank you in advance to all the folks that will suggest Zapier, Buffer, etc. But, this isn't a normal use case for any of those tools. Also, I don't want to be for a service. I'm looking for a solution but, to be honest, I'd like to build an open source tool to handle the [DIY Buffer using IFTTT](https://chrisshort.net/drawings/diy-buffer-using-ifttt/) I've cobbled together (and has worked just fine for YEARS). But, I don't have the skills to do it nor the time, even if I did. If you're interested in working on such a project, let me know. I can provide support, full credit where it's due, and mentions throughout all the work I do.

## Process

[The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data](https://amzn.to/2XqekFl) — In *The Unicorn Project*, we follow Maxine, a senior lead developer, and architect, as she is exiled to the Phoenix Project, to the horror of her friends and colleagues, as punishment for contributing to a payroll outage. She tries to survive in what feels like a heartless and uncaring bureaucracy and to work within a system where no one can get anything done without endless committees, paperwork, and approvals. Out now!

[The New Norm: Trend Micro Security Predictions for 2020](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/research-and-analysis/predictions/2020) — There are a lot of problems to solve out there. But, now those problems can get really big before we're able to even respond.

[Caller Poses as CISA Rep in Extortion Scam](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/11/29/caller-poses-cisa-rep-extortion-scam) — The best weapon against malware and phishing attacks are educated humans. Teach people how to identify malware/mail and you'll be in a much better security posture.

[Why the Midwest Is a Hotbed for Innovation](https://fortune.com/2019/11/15/chris-olsen-drive-capital/) — There is somewhat of a bias against venture capital in tech to spent in the middle part of the US. Turns out, there's a lot of great talent and infrastructure out here.

[Facebook and Instagram crash on Thanksgiving](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/28/facebook-instagram-crash-thanksgiving) — It's interesting that we look up to companies like Facebook and Twitter as examples of managing scale in microservices and users. But, it's also really interesting when they falter on a holiday I would expect an increase in capacity being needed for.

[Did You Forget the Ops in DevOps?](https://www.infoq.com/articles/did-you-forget-ops-in-devops/) — Yeah, you probably did. But, there is a way to recover.

[Hope Is Not A Strategy: How Hardware Issues Affect Your PostgreSQL Data](https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/hope-is-not-a-strategy-the-hpe-ssd-issues-and-protecting-your-postgresql-data) — This is why hardware matters. HPE has a bug that is killing SSDs after a little over three years. "Remember, 'the cloud is just someone else's computer', right? Now that you are aware of the firmware issue you should be asking some questions of your own..."

[A hacking group is hijacking Docker systems with exposed API endpoints](https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacking-group-is-hijacking-docker-systems-with-exposed-api-endpoints/)

[VMware Stock Could Fall as Kubernetes Cloud Shift Comes Too Late](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-cloud-containers-kubernetes-51574459195) — You have to wonder if VMware is making so much noise because they know the Kubernetes ship has long left the dock. They do have to execute on a number of things and last I heard, a lot of the decisions still needed to be made on what is net new and what is reused from VMware's existing portfolio. That's kinda wild considering VMware wants to release Tanzu sooner rather than later. If VMware is successful (which I believe they will be to a certain degree), we're probably all going to look back on it as a major dodged bullet by VMware. Same with Red Hat being bought by IBM. It's an awesome time to be in tech right now.
