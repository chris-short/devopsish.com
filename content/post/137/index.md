[DiversityTickets: AnsibleFest 2019 Atlanta](https://diversitytickets.org/en/events/488) — The Ansible team is using DiversityTickets again this year to make sure folks have an opportunity to attend AnsibleFest Atlanta. "This diversity program is aimed to help underrepresented groups in tech to attend and lowering the barriers for them. This includes but isn’t limited to: women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled people."

[CloudSkills.fm 030: Cloud Native Ops with Ansible and Kubernetes](https://cloudskills.fm/030) — I sat down with Mike Pfeiffer to talk about, "Ansible, Kubernetes, and the importance of building up your Linux skills as the industry transitions into a cloud native world." This was a lot of fun.

[House Hearing on Facebook Libra: Why was the Rust language chosen?](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4808083/rust-language-chosen) — Huh.
