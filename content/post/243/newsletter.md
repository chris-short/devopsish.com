[bellwether](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bellwether) ‚Äî noun ‚Äî a person or thing that shows the existence or direction of a trend; index.

I want to introduce a metric I use to evaluate potential employers. I have bellwethers. People that I respect and whose work interests me. I use them to gauge my potential for success at a company. I keep a mental list of folks and where they're working. In some cases, when I start to evaluate a specific employer, I check how long they've been there and often ask folks who have been there a long time how to succeed.
These bellwethers have to be people you can call or chat with when you have questions. Often they're folks that you have established relationships. Even better, have a bunch of bellwethers; this way, if you end up with multiple opportunities, you know folks at each potential employer, you can have a chat. These can be local, national, or international. But, two keys, you have to know them and have a lot of them.

If your bellwethers are starting to gather in one place, you know something is up and should investigate. If you know your bellwethers are leaving a specific company, you know organizations you should approach with caution. If all of a sudden your bellwethers are all in flux, that's a clear indicator you should start putting feelers out there. But, if you suddenly begin considering opportunities, you can quickly short circuit your search by reaching out to your bellwethers. It's not always what you know. More often than not, it's who your know.

[Red Hat to hire fewer senior engineers after budget frozen](https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/05/red_hat_jobs/)  
Dodged that bullet. "'All current reqs and future backfills will be down-leveled by one level by default (e.g., Senior Software Engineer to Software Engineer),' the memo explained." Red Hat might be top heavy, I'll give the C-suite that. But, they're also one of the lower paying employers in tech too. In essence, this was a preventable event, the low pay necessitated the inflation of titles, which has now led to a perceived top heaviness. Regardless, I feel more confident about the timing behind my recent employment decisions.

[Judge buys Rittenhouse lawyer's inane argument that Apple's pinch-to-zoom manipulates footage](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim)  
"Judge Schroeder argued that it was the prosecution ‚Äî not the defense ‚Äî that had the burden of proving that Apple doesn't use artificial intelligence to manipulate footage, demanding that they provide an expert to testify, and didn't allow the prosecution to adjourn to find that expert before bringing Rittenhouse up for cross-examination." Last I checked... This is a bald face lie and this judge is forcing the prosecution to prove an apparition created without actual evidence by the defense. Holy smokes.

[The Monstrosity Email Has Become](https://ploum.net/the-monstrosity-email-has-become/)  
Email is **hard**. Run a public facing mail server with multiple users and you'll quickly feel like you're on the wrong end of the value chain. DKIM, SPF, DMARC, BIMI, MX, proving to the mail provider you actually own the domain, and a host of other foot guns will find you wondering where you went wrong starting a newsletter some nights. Oh wait... That's my story. "Your mail inbox is becoming a battlefield where everyone with a small authority fight for your attention, trying to fill your mental space even if you don't open the mail."

[The Service Mesh: What Every Engineer Needs to Know about the World's Most Over-Hyped Technology](https://buoyant.io/service-mesh-manifesto/)  
"The architecture of the service mesh has a couple big implications. For one, since the proxy featureset is designed for service-to-service calls, the service mesh really only makes sense if your application is built as services. You could use it with a monolith, but it would be a whole lot of machinery to run a single proxy, and the featureset wouldn't be a great fit." A good read.
