          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>There is <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4h4db5">a line in Saving Private Ryan about griping</a>. There&rsquo;s a chain of command in the military and leadership voices its concerns up the chain, never down it. This week, I&rsquo;ve been reaching up my chain of command in government to make sure that the people that are supposed to be leading right now are. I would encourage you to do the same. Some good news this week is that after announcing an initiative to harness a global computer network to contribute work towards pharmaceutical drugs to combat COVID-19, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/foldinghome-surpasses-400-000-users-amid-crypto-contribution">Folding@Home has seen a 1200% increase in computers actively contributing to the project</a>. I set up four systems to run Folding@Home this week as part of this effort. But, on Friday, I had to back down to three due to fan noise. I would also encourage you to donate any spare CPU and GPU cycles you have to the project. Together we can beat COVID-19.</p>

            &ldquo;EARN IT for short, is an attempt to force online service providers (e.g. Facebook, Google, etc.) to follow a set of &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; determined by a commission, to combat the scourge of CSAM; the composition of that commission makes it clear that end-to-end encryption will not be one of those practices, but companies that do not follow the best practices will lose liability protection for their users&rsquo; actions. It is, in brief, an attempt to force providers to either abandon true end-to-end encryption or face ruinous lawsuitsâ€”all without &lsquo;seeming&rsquo; to be about encryption at all.&rdquo;</p>

            I installed Tailscale this week on several systems. It&rsquo;s a dead-simple WireGuard VPN implementation. I am a little wary of it, but it is handy to have &lsquo;direct&rsquo; access to systems from anywhere. If installing WireGuard on everything were this easy, I&rsquo;d have done it already.</p>
