[Digital WTF by Coté](https://leanpub.com/digitalwtf) — My buddy Micheal Coté published a book. The foreword was written by my old boss and buddy, John Willis. I wouldn't be a good friend if I didn't mention it. "When you're finished being inspired, this book is waiting for you, like a forgotten twenty dollar bill in that lambskin trucker jacket you haven't worn in 16 years."

## Process
