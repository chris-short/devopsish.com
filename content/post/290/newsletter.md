**Side note**: I'm out of spoons some weeks and don't write an intro. I'm not going to apologize for that. Last week's newsletter wasn't my best, but I make up for it this week. It's all about the long haul. Feel free to hit reply anytime.

One of the more useful things I created this week was with the help of fellow Amazonian, [Tom "Spot" Calloway](https://twitter.com/spotfoss). Spot asked me, as a local, to suggest to him some great restaurants here in Detroit. I sat down with a list of the top 200 Detroit restaurants and pointed out all the ones I'd enjoyed over the years. Spot looked at that list and said, "We should make a doc about this." I said, "We should make it publicly available and share it," because people were DM'ing me asking the exact same questions. Spot put great care into curating most of the data.

Please feel free to reference the [KubeCon Detroit Food and Drink Suggestions](https://devopsi.sh/food) should you need to pick a place for dinner one night this week. It has been crowdsourced from locals and packed with all the necessary information to make a decision.

KubeCon North America 2022 is in Detroit this week. I would love to say I had a small part to play in that, but to be honest, it was probably more [Bob](https://twitter.com/mrbobbytables), [Jeff](https://twitter.com/jeefy), and [Jorge](https://twitter.com/castrojo). But, after doing a Twitter Space with [Justin Garrison](https://twitter.com/rothgar) yesterday, I realized it might be worthwhile to explain my journey to Detroit and my efforts over the years to get a tech conference to Detroit.

I first came to Detroit in 2010, the year my wife and I met. Her family lives in the Detroit Metro Area, as we do now. I remember my first Detroit Tigers game back then. The city was grappling with the outcomes of the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession?utm_source=devopsish) (the same recession that sent Julie to Raleigh, NC where we‚Äôd later meet). We had many, many more visits between 2010 and 2016. I enjoyed the trips, even the snowy ones. I spent time in Denver in the military, so Michigan weather wasn‚Äôt anything new to me. I loved Raleigh, but it wasn't like Tampa or Denver, with sports teams and all the big city things I'd come to enjoy over the years.

Fast forward a few years, in 2016, my then boss, Josh Wyatt, convinced me I should get into public speaking. I was in a role identified as a mentor and leader within our DevOps practice. I made lifelong friends in that role. It was one of the best jobs I had in all the hopping around I had to do in Raleigh. As it turns out, you're grossly underpaid coming from the military and as we all know, the best way to get a raise in tech is to change jobs.

As I submitted [CFPs](https://chrisshort.net/abstracts/) and got rejected, I started evolving my thinking about the proposals. I would always ask for feedback if any was available, and I would iterate on existing CFPs. But, I hit gold when I came to the realization that a lot of the things I was doing in 2016 were incredibly similar to what I did in 2000 when I was stationed in Virginia. I was a disabled veteran and actively working in a DevOps organization. I finally made a CFP worthy of acceptance at a strategically chosen DevOpsDays Detroit: [What the Military Taught Me About DevOps](https://chrisshort.net/abstracts/what-the-military-taught-me-about-devops/?utm_source=devopsish)

By that point, we were spending all our vacation time in Michigan. My parent's made a series of terrible, backstabbing, subverting, and rude decisions and statements. I finally ended that toxic relationship thus relieving us of any attachment to North Carolina aside from our good friends. This cleared an opportunity for us.

I had free room and board here in the Detroit Metro Area, so we all drove up from Raleigh for the event. I came deep into downtown by myself for the first time ever. From walking around the conference venue, and looking out on the city from the venue, I saw a city planting seeds of awesomeness and generally cleaning things up. It was that week that the seed was planted. "We're moving to Detroit," and DevOpsDays was the springboard we needed.

I impressed a couple of companies with my talk. I came up to Detroit for a few interviews 2016/2017. I finally got a good offer with relocation from a company I knew nothing about but they were practicing DevOps as I learned from the senior engineers on the teams. That was good enough for me. I didn't bother with a site visit. Lesson Learned: Always visit the office even if the office is on the other side of the globe. That was the worst office I ever worked in. It was cool to be downtown. But, in 2017, your senses were bombarded by construction sounds and vibrations constantly.

I went to KubeCon NA 2017 in Austin (where it snowed ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èÔ∏è), long story short, as someone looking for a job. I met Jorge Castro one night for a beer. We talked about tech, Michigan, the VA, etc. Right before he left, Jorge mentioned I should apply to be a [CNCF Ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/) (which, through it all, I still am). DevOps'ish was a year old at that point, being in DevOps, and working in SIG ContribEx was apparently the right mix because in January 2018 I was named a CNCF Ambassador. That month I also got a new job reporting to a wonderful mentor and friend, [John Willis](https://twitter.com/botchagalupe).

Through the following years, I always made sure that any chance I got I would be Detroit's hype man. I got to the point where a signature of any of my talks was a slide of recent pictures of downtown Detroit and a statement about [how awesome the city had become](https://youtu.be/-lLjEQx0H4I?utm_source=devopsish).

Fast forward to 2019 when I get a rather special request from the Red Hat Events team. They asked if I could do a site survey of a hotel in downtown for a 2020 event. Yes, they knew I was quite biased. But, they also knew that I knew their style and could be objective about any site survey. I showed up early to eat in the hotel. When I met the manager, I told her I was impressed by the bar staff and my meal was good. She knew I wasn't fucking around at that point. This wasn't gonna be an easy one. With a Google Doc open on my phone I proceeded to thoroughly scour the hotel. I walked about a total of a mile and a half to get photos of the surrounding area and note amenities nearby. The site survey was accepted and the event was cleared to come to Detroit. I was so excited! A real tech event from Red Hat coming to Detroit. Then COVID happened.

Fast forward ahead an eternity and somehow the Ann Arbor Kubernetes crew was able to get some folks to fall through as they bounced from coast to coast. It was really awesome to see some of the friends I had so dearly missed during the pandemic actually here in Michigan.

Apparently, a helluva impression was made. At KubeCon L.A., I was in my hotel room watching the keynotes as I did a little work. When they announced that Detroit was going to be the next KubeCon NA location, I cried I was so happy. This KubeCon is very special to us in Detroit. It's a MAJOR tech conference putting itself in the same space as the North American International Auto Show (the crown jewel of Detroit events).

Let's make this the best KubeCon yet, y'all.

Ashley Belanger, Ars Technica  
I treat DevOps'ish like a second job. The separation of the two is very real though. I don't need to go into great detail but there are clear boundaries where one job happens and another job happens. Everything was great until the "Allow Paste" bug showed up on iPadOS. I could work from separate devices even on the road.

Mark Harrisarchive page, MIT Technology Review  
This article sucked me in like it had Hoover written on the front of it as it went back and forth over me. Having helped maintain many a satellite link in my days, as well as being an avid GPS consumer, this was a fascinating article that made you think real hard what you could do with just the sync parts of an otherwise encrypted signal.

Ubuntu  
"OpenSSH in Ubuntu 22.10 is configured by default to use systemd socket activation, meaning that sshd will not be started until an incoming connection request is received. This reduces the memory footprint of Ubuntu Server on smaller devices, VMs or LXD containers." Among various and sundry things, the SSH bits are the most interesting to me.
