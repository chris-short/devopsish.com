**ICYMI on Notes**: In [DevOps'ish 278](https://devopsish.com/278/) I will no longer publish the weekly notes file on the website. They are still [made available on GitHub][1] as they have been for the past 170 issues. If you're curious about the why: spam emails that came as a result. Yeah, funny how that works.
