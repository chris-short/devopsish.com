KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2021 in Downtown Los Angeles was fantastic. I got to see friends I hadn't seen in a long time and some people I met for the first time. "I didn't realize you were so tall" was a common statement from people I was meeting for the first time. It was very cool to meet folks in the community and Red Hat for the first time. It was also interesting to see new companies entering the cloud native ecosystem. I spent more than one time looking up companies or products I'd not heard of before. It was also interesting NOT to see Google Cloud or VMware there. Those companies opted not to get a booth based on their company COVID-19 policies.

It was a little weird being in such a large venue with only a few thousand people. The L.A. Convention Center made for some long walks. I ended up crushing my Apple Health rings every day. Except for maybe the last day on site. One thing I noted after day two was that I was very dehydrated. You can't drink while wearing a mask. It got to the point where I drank a liter to two liters before the conference. Retreat outside and drink as much water as possible. I was then drinking a ton of water at the end of the day.

I was pleased with how my shoulder performed overall too. I used more lidocaine than usual while staying ahead of the pain curve. It worked until the last day. Then a little after 5 PM PT, the spasms started and didn't stop until I was in bed. It was the kind of "arm ripping off" pain that wasn't going away. I never really adjusted to being on the west coast either. After not traveling for so long and no travel on the immediate horizon, my body was not motivated enough to jump over to west coast time. Which made for long days, but I hit the ground running on Saturday.

Overall, it was a great conference. I wish everyone had equal access. Also, I can't wait to show y'all Detroit next year.

[IBM Proposing A CPU Namespace For The Linux Kernel - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-CPU-Namespace)  
"The CPU namespace isolates CPU information by virtualizing logical CPU IDs and creating a scrambled virtual CPU map of the same. It latches onto the task_struct and is the cpu translations designed to be in a flat hierarchy this means that every virtual namespace CPU maps to a physical CPU at the creation of the namespace. The advantage of a flat hierarchy is that translations are O(1) and children do not need to traverse up the tree to retrieve a translation."

[Multicloud failover is almost always a terrible idea](https://cloudpundit.com/2021/10/14/multicloud-failover-is-almost-always-a-terrible-idea/)  
"Regulators, risk managers, and plenty of IT management largely think of AWS, Azure, etc. as monolithic entities, where 'the cloud' can just break for them, and then kaboom, everything is dead everywhere worldwide. They imagine one gargantuan amorphous data center, subject to all the problems that can afflict single data centers, or single systems. But that's not how it works, that's not the most effective way to address risk, and testing the 'resilience of the provider' (as a generic whole) is both impossible and meaningless."
