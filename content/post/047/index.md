If you [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort), you know I spent the first half of the week in Raleigh attending [All Things Open](https://allthingsopen.org/) and [hanging out with my opensource.com family](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bar4enlAXVV/?hl=en&taken-by=thechrisshort). All Things Open is one of my most looked forward to conferences of the year. I had already committed to attending before I moved to Detroit and I'm so glad I was able to go. One of the coolest things I did while there was announcing a new [**Opensource.com DevOps Team**](https://opensource.com/devops-team) with Jason Hibbets on the main stage after my lightning talk. [Join us on this journey](https://opensource.com/devops-team)! It's going to be awesome!
