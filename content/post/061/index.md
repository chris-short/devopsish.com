I've had an absolutely amazing week! I was named a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation Ambassador](https://chrisshort.net/chris-short-named-cloud-native-ambassador/). My friend, Chris Bailey, and I recorded an episode of [Techtown's Discussing DevOps Details (3D) Podcast](http://techtowntraining.com/podcastgen/). I spoke at the [Orchestructure January 2018 Meetup](https://chrisshort.net/orchestructure-january-2018-meetup/) about Golang accelerating DevOps. Last, but certainly not least, I was named an [opensource.com 2018 People's Choice Award](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/community-awards-2018) winner. I also booked travel for Open Source 101 in Raleigh and DevOpsDays Charlotte. I don't know how I can top this week. But, I tend to compete with myself; I'm sure I'll come up with something.

## People

[WHATIS Going to Happen With WHOIS?](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbpgga/whois-gdpr-europe-icann-registrar) Why is this a people issue? Because to display an EU citizen's name in WHOIS data would be illegal under the GDPR. ICANN is trying to figure out how to meet their transparency goals while still complying with the [GDPR](https://www.eugdpr.org/).

## Process

[CoreOS](https://coreos.com/blog/coreos-agrees-to-join-red-hat/) is being acquired by [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership) for $250 million! However, people in the community are holding judgment on if this is a good thing. [Container Linux will stick around](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/coreos-user/GR4YlF2c1dM). But, the Openshift team fired off [an ill-advised tweet that was later removed](http://web.archive.org/web/20180131115004/https://twitter.com/openshift/status/958454802605846528). The tweet stated, "With the acquisition of CoreOS, Red Hat engineers now Lead or Co-Lead 15 Kubernetes SIGs." As [Joseph Jacks pointed out](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/958494559347986433), "This should be a call for broader community participation to avoid single-vendor concentration." I couldn't agree more. I now believe Google and Red Hat have WAY too much power in the Kubernetes ecosystem. But, It's better than just Google OR Red Hat having too much power.
