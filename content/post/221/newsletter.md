The Cloud Native community lost a great person; [Peeyush Gupta](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/main/peeyush-gupta.md). He leaves behind a wife and 10-month old child. His employer, Digital Ocean, and the Kubernetes community are trying very hard to make that that mother and child will not be *as devastated*. **I beg of you**, please donate to the [**Peeyush Gupta: Family Education Fund**](https://milaap.org/fundraisers/support-peeyush-gupta-family-education).

*If half the DevOps'ish readership gave $25, we'll hit the current goal of Rs.5,500,000.*

It's been surprisingly difficult for me to deal with the loss of Peeyush. I think I've learned death doesn't get easier with age, at least when the person is a decade younger than you—my deepest condolences to the Gupta family. I cannot imagine what you are dealing with right now.

I've made two public statements on Peeyush's death. Please accept my apologies for quoting myself here.

"I was gobsmacked by the news. The impact Peeyush has had in the community is a large one. It's not possible to sit down and look at GitHub to capture Peeyush's work. It extended into so much more than code."  —Chris Short, [Heartfelt Remembrance for Peeyush Gupta (pensu)](https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-dev/c/WpTM45LCkRY)

"Peeyush made me look forward to going to the K8s Upstream Marketing meetings. I was devastated last week when I heard the news. But, he's not gone, his work lives on through his code. He'll be missed deeply." —Chris Short, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1399782389589725191)

[Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook)  
When I first read Apple's policy, it was very apparent to me that the leadership at the company has not learned anything from this pandemic. If you work at Apple, I really do feel for you right now. Your psychological safety might be in jeopardy. There are companies  that will be mostly remote going forward ([my employer](https://devopsish.com/terms/#disclaimer) was mostly remote before the pandemic). If you need a referral into Red Hat, let me know.

Deleting social media history is going to be a big thing in the near future. I assume people understand I'm not the same person I was four years ago let alone fourteen years ago when I joined Twitter. I deleted my Facebook account recently considering it had been dormant for quite some time.
