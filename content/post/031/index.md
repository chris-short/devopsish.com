This week was nuts. We dealt with a service degradation due to issues between our CDN and data center edge network. On a long, holiday weekend it's the last thing you want to deal with. There were eighteen action items to come out of the post mortem (which was long enough to merit an executive summary). This was one of the weirder issues I have ever seen as it involved three different companies and a few bad hops in a network path. [I quoted Baruch Sadogursky two weeks ago](/029/), "Pain is instructional." It definitely is! Meanwhile, my company, Bankrate, was [getting acquired by Red Ventures](http://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/07/04/red-ventures-digs-deep-bankrate-website-124bn-personal-finance-drive) for $1.24 billion.

Hopefully, the week ahead will be calmer. Doubtful given I'll be in Atlanta on Monday, Denver on Tuesday, back in North Carolina on Sunday, and then back to Michigan later the following. Next week's edition of DevOps'ish Weekly will be written right after the conclusion of [GopherCon 2017](https://gophercon.com/)! I'm attending GopherCon for the first time ever and am so thankful to have the opportunity to do so. If you're there ask me for a DevOps'ish sticker.

This how to is good and I especially think asking every candidate the same questions is very important.
