          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>I was going to make a list of things you could learn this week but, the tech world got a notable call to arms this week. We need more COBOL developers in the US. <a href="https://thenewstack.io/u-s-unemployment-surge-highlights-dire-need-for-cobol-skills/">The glut of unemployment claims</a> has crippled mainframe systems designed to run in a satisfactory government manner under normal conditions. &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/manicode/status/1246497036389793792">The governor of New Jersey just put out the call on live TV that he is desperate for Cobol programmers right now.</a>&rdquo; As insane as this sounds, it's true (and long overdue). We don't need to modernize this; it's not able to run as-is. We need more COBOL programmers now. The University of Limerick has a free <a href="http://www.csis.ul.ie/cobol/course/Default.htm">COBOL programming course</a>. IBM also has a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/it-infrastructure/z/education/master-the-mainframe">Master the Mainframe</a> course that you can take online now. Even if you don't need a job right now, maybe you know someone who does. We can solve two problems at once here!</p>

            Be like a shoe and just do it.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.ciodive.com/news/linux-containers-kubernetes/575506/">Why Linux containers are a CIO&rsquo;s best friend</a><br />
            &ldquo;Linux containers enable developers to package and isolate applications with their entire runtime environment. This makes it easier (and less expensive) to move fully functional applications among dev, test, production and other environments. In turn, it makes it possible to meet the never-ending internal and external demand for those applications.&rdquo;</p>

          <p><a href="https://terazo.com/providing-business-value-with-observability/">Webinar: Providing Business Value Through Observability</a><br />
            My good friend, one of the most brilliant minds in DevOps, and great engineering leader, <a href="https://twitter.com/seebails">Chris Bailey</a>, is talking to the universe about observability for free. You should register, I did.</p>

          <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/tech/microsoft-12-weeks-parental-leave/index.html">Microsoft is giving workers 12 weeks of paid parental leave because of school disruptions</a><br />
            &ldquo;Microsoft is giving its workers an additional three months of paid parental leave to deal with extended school closures due to the coronavirus outbreak&hellip; The company is calling the program &lsquo;12-Week Paid Pandemic School and Childcare Closure Leave.&rsquo;&rdquo; My jaw dropped when I read this. I don&rsquo;t know the complete logistics of it, but having it as an option would be amazing.</p>

          <p><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/04/how-to-manage-your-stress-when-the-sky-is-falling">How to Manage Your Stress When the Sky Is Falling</a><br />
            &ldquo;It's natural to feel stressed right now. As we try to navigate our new normal, we're worried about getting sick or losing our jobs, we're inundated with news about death tolls and an economic recession, and we're isolated from coworkers, friends, and family.&rdquo;</p>

            This is brilliant and intense. This is how you keep bad shit from running in your cluster. A little automation and you can find leaky points in your processes and infrastructure at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>

            &ldquo;In this blog post we have a closer look at how Ansible can help to overcome these challenges and support investigation enrichment activities. In the following example we'll see how Ansible can be used to enable programmatic access to information like logs coming from technologies that may not be integrated into a SIEM.&rdquo;</p>
