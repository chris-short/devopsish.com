This is not how I wanted things to end.

I've been dealing with an elbow injury for a while. I finally went to the doctor's to figure out what was going on. That became the least of my worries shortly thereafter. I've been diagnosed with yet another ailment. This time it's my heart ü´Ä. **I'm under explicit doctor's orders to cut stressors out** and do things that **bring me more joy**. Basically, I need to spend less time on things that stress me out.

Writing a newsletter is like working under a constant deadline. DevOps'ish is many hours of extra work every week. I walk on a razor's edge to continue managing it as an independent brand while working a full-time day job at a major cloud provider. DevOps'ish turned into a second job and income stream years ago. At the very least, I've proven I can do it (which means I could always do it again).

Every Q4 (October), I ponder long and hard about continuing DevOps'ish. It was a topic of discussion at KubeCon with my close friends. Before I got the doctor's order, I had decided to put DevOps'ish into hiatus mode at the end of the year. It has been an excellent six-year run. I've learned a lot, and I hope you have too. But, in light of this recent news, I have to idle the newsletter immediately.

DevOps'ish has accomplished its primary goals. It was important to me in 2016 to make a name for myself in this industry, have a tool to help further my career, and as a bonus, become a [respected DevOps publication][1].

All good things must come to an end. It's hard to let go of something you've built. As I said, I wanted it to go differently. A few folks have offered to help over the years, but I liked the tone of DevOps'ish to stay the same. My morals and values drive the newsletter. That's almost impossible to replicate.

What happens now?

The list of emails will be cared for like state secrets (stored behind many keys and locks). If DevOps'ish gets sold, you will be asked to opt in again. This newsletter is more concerned about your privacy than open and click rates. In the interim, [devopsish.com][2] will remain up. The [GitHub repo][3] isn't going anywhere, either. The [subreddit][4] will remain available for now as well.

I'm holding out a modicum of hope that I can optimize the time-consuming parts of making the newsletter. If I reach a point health-wise where I can return to DevOps'ish, I will. It might return only as a [podcast][11] (which is shutting down, too, for now) or live stream. Right now, that's not a pressing matter.

Most importantly, **thank you**.

Thank you for your close to six years of readership. I appreciate the supportive messages over the years. I owe you if you're a friend who helped me along the way. Thank you to the haters, too (you were gasoline on my fire). Thank you to the many sponsors over the years (especially [Honeycomb][12]) My views of what's essential in DevOps and any organization trying to move faster still apply today: People, Processes, and Tools, in that order. Strong opinions, loosely held. Assume positive intent (unless indicated otherwise).

I'm not going anywhere. I will still be on social media (with fewer Suggested Reads; I still need to figure out what I'm doing with that system). I'll still be writing at [chrisshort.net][5] ([RSS][6]). I will enable [RSS][10] for DevOps'ish in case there is news in the future. I'll also be figuring out how to manage better the stress I put on myself to do things (this will be a hot topic at therapy next week).

**So long for now. I wish you all the best of luck.**

[Elon Musk begins mass layoffs of Twitter staff](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/03/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs/)  
Faiz Siddiqui, The Washington Post  
Friday was a really sad day on the Twitters. "Employees said the layoffs came across teams, as Twitter broadly reduced its workforce. Musk originally pitched investors on cutting Twitter's staff up to 75 percent."

Catherine Thorbecke, CNN Business via WRAL TechWire  
"In a memo to staffers on Thursday, a copy of which was shared with CNN Business, Lyft (LYFT) co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer said the layoffs will impact every part of the company, and pointed to broader macroeconomic challenges that led to the cuts."

Hanna Ingber, The New York Times  
For folks like me, the office is a hinderance. My home office is purpose built for me and my varying needs. You're not going to give me a corner office, with furniture, and all the bonuses of being able to source your own supplies (coffee, soda, LaCroix, lunch, etc.). "Commutes are still painful, readers say. And it's hard to give up the joys of working from home. But many of those who have gone back to the office say they like it."

Alexander Block, Kubernetes Blog  
"One of the main philosophies that Kluctl follows is "live and let live", meaning that it will try its best to work in conjunction with any other tool or controller running outside or inside your clusters. Kluctl will not overwrite any fields that it lost ownership of, unless you explicitly tell it to do so."
