My week started out great! Spring had finally sprung here in Michigan. But, with that came something I'm allergic to. Then that turned into a sinus infection. That has now expanded into a horrible cough. I have already had one doctor's visit. But, it was a VA doc since I already had an appointment there. It might be time to see a real doctor.

[Three-day no-meeting schedule for engineers](https://medium.com/@Pinterest_Engineering/three-day-no-meeting-schedule-for-engineers-fca9f857a567): We did something a lot like this at McClathy Interactive. We had all our cross departmental meetings on Monday and Friday. Every day, your organizational unit had a standup/scrum spanning all projects (no longer than 15 minutes, first thing in the morning). Every time I walk into a new workcenter I espouse the benefits of this model. A huge thanks to Ted Boggs and Steve Coile for letting me work in this model. It was glorious!

Things like Twitter, GitLab, GitHub, and Google are critical services I cannot afford to have compromised. I have two-factor authentication obviously but, there has to be more I can do, right? No? Okay fine.
