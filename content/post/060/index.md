There are terrible people in this world. I've known that for a very, very long time. There are those that twist religion to benefit themselves, double-crossers, and [people who will have their co-workers swatted just for existing](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/). But, you cannot add yourself to that list in the process of "being American." You are the epitome of a loser if you target people because of their race, gender identity, political leanings, sexual orientation, or disability. If you work at Google, you clearly have done something right in life. I'm pretty sure Google doesn't let just anyone in the door. It is high time we leave our beliefs and prejudices outside of the work place. We're all in this thing called life on this place called earth together; it's time to start acting like it.

[**Support The Cloudcast during the Krispy Kreme Challenge!**](https://www.crowdrise.com/thecloudcastnet)
Since 2013, Aaron Delp and Brian Gracely have asked the community to donate to the Krispy Kreme Challenge with the goal of making things better for children and families at the NC Children's Hospital. **Deadline for donations is February 3rd**. This is one of my favorite [causes](https://chrisshort.net/causes/)!


## People

[The Dirty War Over Diversity Inside Google](https://www.wired.com/story/the-dirty-war-over-diversity-inside-google/): This is insane. People I know are being impacted by this and it's happening in what was one of the good places to work.

[You need SRE skills to thrive in a serverless world — Kelsey Hightower](https://read.acloud.guru/you-need-sre-skills-to-thrive-in-a-serverless-world-kelsey-hightower-340a002b3730) from A Cloud Guru

[HI-EMA 'button pusher' refusing to cooperate with FCC, internal investigators](http://www.staradvertiser.com/2018/01/24/breaking-news/schatz-to-lead-hearing-on-alert-systems-in-wake-of-hawaii-blunder/): I wouldn't cooperate either if I were the scapegoat. Meanwhile, [legislation has been introduced](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-missiles-falsealarm-congress/u-s-senator-from-hawaii-says-states-should-not-send-missile-alerts-idUSKBN1FE1E7) in Congress to take over the missile alert system in Hawaii.

[Women Who Go: A New Regime](https://medium.com/@sadams.codes/women-who-go-a-new-regime-40047e2ce4b0): I am deeply saddened that Sarah Adams is leaving the Go community. When I attended GopherCon last year it was, to that point, the biggest conference I've been to. Sarah was the one person in the whole of Denver to get me out of my shell. She has been a source of inspiration to me as I've learned to deal with some of my anxiety issues of late.

## Process

[You Build It, You Secure It](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/code-security) by John Willis

[Why successful DevOps implementation requires a "cultural change"](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-successfully-implementing-devops-requires-a-cultural-change-within-a-company/): I remember working in support and ops at McClatchy Interactive. A lot of our problems could have been solved relatively quickly if developers were responsible for maintaining the code in production. Flattening your organization's structure could take you a long way in your DevOps transformation (assuming you have hired for that; skills matter).

[Choose a loosely coupled architecture for DevOps success](http://searchcloudapplications.techtarget.com/feature/Choose-a-loosely-coupled-architecture-for-DevOps-success)

[DevOps Metrics](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3182626): Your biggest mistake might be collecting the wrong data.

[WIP Limit — A further study](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2018/01/wip-limit-a-further-study/): I had a WIP limit issue this week. It caused me an illogical amount of anxiety. Then I read this article and I felt a little better.

## Tools

[Jessie Frazelle spoke about all things containers this week at Linux Conf AU](https://youtu.be/7mzbIOtcIaQ). [Her slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UuHvR_kvZ3BF1pSXyv4mMKX9vmGr7GXm97USx7mzTXY/) are something that I'll be saving in Evernote for continual future reference. I'd just like to point out that Jess went through 200 poignant slides in less than an hour. It is making me completely rethink how I present at conferences from this point forward.

[Ansible Service Broker](http://automationbroker.io/): This looks REALLY cool but the Ansible team really needs to tighten up on the branding real quick here.

[nginxconfig.io](https://nginxconfig.io/): If you maintain nginx servers you need this.
