**Happy Halloween ðŸŽƒðŸ’€ðŸ‘»**

I started my new role as a [Senior Developer Advocate on the AWS Kubernetes team](https://chrisshort.net/joining-amazon-elastic-kubernetes-service-team/) this week. Working for the second largest employer in the United States and the #1 cloud in the world is an extremely interesting dynamic. I'm adapting slowly but surely to the scale. It has a surprisingly familiar feel. I guess that's what happens when one of your friends brings you in. But, I also have so many friends at AWS and Amazon too. It's not like the Kubernetes world is that big to begin with. Tech isn't that much bigger. But, it's nice someone you met in 2017, another person you met in 2018, and on and on is DM'ing you welcome messages throughout the week. I genuinely feel appreciated. It's an odd feeling; I don't think I've ever felt to this extent. I have a very real feeling of belonging. Also, Max turned six this weekend. It's been a really good week. I hope your upcoming week is awesome!

NOTE: [Alison Dowdney](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisondowdney/)) is looking for a new opportunity. She's an absolute powerhouse in the Kubernetes community.

Also, Please take part in this Twitter poll about rebranding the newsletter. I would love your feedback. Feel free to hit reply too.

The places that can let you work remotely and don't will have a tough time recruiting I'd imagine. The pandemic is a real game changer for how we work, especially in this sector.

Having a preconfigured infrastructure and a practiced plan for using it when there's a deviation from your baseline will help you to extract and analyze the information needed to determine the impact, scope, and root cause of an incident and return to operations confidently."
