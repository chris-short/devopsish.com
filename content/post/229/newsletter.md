Kubernetes 1.22 shipped this week. I suggest you at a minimum read the [release blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/04/kubernetes-1-22-release-announcement/) or take a gander at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) and definitely read the [No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#no-really-you-must-read-this-before-you-upgrade). Some of the bigger changes:

* Audit log files are created with mode 0600 (owner read-only)
* Rootless mode containers moving to alpha: In my opinion, if you use Podman, you're used to this. If you're not, you should be using rootless containers intentionally for security reasons (more on that later).
* Cgroupsv2 moving to alpha
* Pod Security Policy replacement (aka Pod Security Admission Controller): Yes, [PSPs are deprecated](https://devopsish.com/205/) and being replaced. [There are a lot of reasons why](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/).
* LoadBalancer moving to beta
* Enable seccomp by default
* and a whole bunch more

KubeCon NA 2021 acceptances went out this week and [the schedule is live](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/). I'm excited to say I'm teaming up with [Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields), [Bart Farrell](https://twitter.com/birthmarkbart), [Matthew Broberg](https://twitter.com/mbbroberg), and [Kunal Kushwaha](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt) for [a panel talk](https://kccncna2021.sched.com/event/lV3S) about what we've been doing in the [Kubernetes Upstream Marketing Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team) (which includes the [@K8sContributors](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/) Twitter handle and so much more).

A note about KubeCon: I want everyone that might be speaking at a Day 0 event or trying to get to KubeCon to know that if anyone needs financial support, please apply for a scholarship, either diversity or needs-based here: <https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/>

## DevOps'ish Tweet of the Week

I know AWS has a UX team. I don't know if AWS listens to their UX team though.

[![C:\hristina (@divinetechygirl) on Twitter: "Does AWS make AWS confusing on purpose or ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø¬Ø¬Ø? Like you shouldn't have to study for a cert just to figure out how to do things in the UI ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Please note: I do not need help and figured out how to do what I needed to do but it was definitely not straight forward."](/images/229-devopsish-tweet-of-the-week.png)](https://twitter.com/divinetechygirl/status/1422954646918864905)
