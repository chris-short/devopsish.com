Kubernetes 1.22 shipped this week. I suggest you, at a minimum, read the [release blog post](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/08/04/kubernetes-1-22-release-announcement/) or take a gander at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md) and definitely read the [No, really, you MUST read this before you upgrade](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.22.md#no-really-you-must-read-this-before-you-upgrade). Some of the bigger changes:

* Audit log files are created with mode 0600 (owner read-only)
* Rootless mode containers moving to alpha: In my opinion, if you use Podman, you're used to this. If you're not, you should be using rootless containers intentionally for security reasons (more on that later).
* Cgroupsv2 moving to alpha
* Pod Security Policy replacement (aka Pod Security Admission Controller): Yes, [PSPs are deprecated](https://devopsish.com/205/) and being replaced. [There are a lot of reasons why](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2021/04/06/podsecuritypolicy-deprecation-past-present-and-future/).
* LoadBalancer moving to beta
* Enable seccomp by default
* and a whole bunch more

KubeCon NA 2021 acceptances went out this week and [the schedule is live](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/program/schedule/). I'm excited to say I'm teaming up with [Kaslin Fields](https://twitter.com/kaslinfields), [Bart Farrell](https://twitter.com/birthmarkbart), [Matthew Broberg](https://twitter.com/mbbroberg), and [Kunal Kushwaha](https://twitter.com/kunalstwt) for [a panel talk](https://kccncna2021.sched.com/event/lV3S) about what we've been doing in the [Kubernetes Upstream Marketing Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/communication/marketing-team) (which includes the [@K8sContributors](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/) Twitter handle and so much more).

A note about KubeCon: I want everyone that might be speaking at a Day 0 event or trying to get to KubeCon to know that if anyone needs financial support, please apply for a scholarship, either diversity or needs-based here: <https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/scholarships/>

Now we enter life with one of the top phone makers having a backdoor into the private lives of its consumers. I can't wait until pictures of Max in the bathtub somehow leading to a search warrant. I have a feeling this isn't going to go well at all for any of us.

[Study reveals racial bias on GitHub](https://www.protocol.com/policy/github-race-bias-study)

[Why Chinese Big Tech no longer dares say '996'](https://www.protocol.com/china/china-996-overtime-era-ended)  
Long overdue. "Over the past two months, at least four Chinese tech giants have announced plans to cancel mandatory overtime; some of the changes are companywide, and others are specific to business units. ByteDance, Kuaishou and Meituan's group-buying platform announced the end of a policy called 'Big/Small Week,' where a six-day workweek is followed by a more moderate schedule. In early June, a game studio owned by Tencent rolled out a policy that mandated employees punch out at 6 p.m. every Wednesday and take the weekends off."

[NSA, CISA release Kubernetes Hardening Guidance](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2716980/nsa-cisa-release-kubernetes-hardening-guidance/)  
This is a big deal. The NSA guides are top-notch reference material. What’s one of the first pieces of guidance? Using non-root containers. There are good example YAMLs in the appendix as well.

It's not all DNS's fault. "What the Wiz team discovered was that several managed DNS providers did not blacklist their own DNS servers inside their backends." Which means, you could easily hijack Amazon and Google's DNS servers to do basically anything you wanted to an unknowing victim or adversary. I reported on this last week but, this sheds a little more light on the subject.
