I've written this newsletter from a lot of places over a variety of internet services. From the WiFi at home, to airplanes, to airport lounges, hotels, AirBnBs, VRBOs, foreign countries, and more, I've written DevOps'ish many different places and ways. But, today is unique because [I'm the way off the beaten path in northern Michigan](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1535736049724530693). We're so far off the beaten track that there's no cell service. There is WiFi from Viasat. I'll say it'll get the job done, but I'm reminded of working at low data rates in far-flung places decades ago. But, I think the view from this one is much better than the others.

Oh and this was my most popular tweet this week.

### [Take the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Survey](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/take-the-2022-state-of-devops-survey?source=devopsish)

Each year the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#reports?source=devopsish) team seek input from technical practitioners in every industry to help all of us understand the practices and capabilities the drive software delivery and operations performance. The research and subsequent reporting are anonymous, academically-rigorous, and platform-agnostic. The research investigates technical, process, measurement, and cultural capabilities. Anyone responsible for prioritizing, building, deploying, or operating software services is encouraged to participate in the survey. [Take the survey to help improve your organization!](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2aXfK0Zw75lvCl0?source=devopsish)
