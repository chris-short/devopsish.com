### [Take the 2022 Accelerate State of DevOps Survey](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/take-the-2022-state-of-devops-survey?source=devopsish)

Each year the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#reports) team seek input from technical practitioners in every industry to help all of us understand the practices and capabilities the drive software delivery and operations performance. The research and subsequent reporting are anonymous, academically-rigorous, and platform-agnostic. The research investigates technical, process, measurement, and cultural capabilities. Anyone responsible for prioritizing, building, deploying, or operating software services is encouraged to participate in the survey. [Take the survey to help improve your organization!](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2aXfK0Zw75lvCl0?source=devopsish)
