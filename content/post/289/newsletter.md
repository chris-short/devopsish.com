Trip Longworth  
I'd encourage you to show this to all your teammates this week. "This talk presents the concept of the Wall of Awful, a metaphor for emotional barriers that keep us from doing the things we supposedly want to do, the neuroscience behind these blockers, and tactics for getting past them and to your goal."

[China’s Internet Censors Race to Quell Beijing Protest Chatter](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/14/world/asia/china-internet-protest-xi-jinping.html)  
Daisuke Wakabayashi and Claire Fu, The New York Times  
"Some search terms were banned, WeChat accounts suspended and songs removed to stop discussion of a rare public protest denouncing Xi Jinping."

Dark Reading  
"Drone-based cyberattacks to spy on corporate targets are no longer hypothetical, one incident from this summer shows."

[Intel Could Be Preparing For Massive Layoffs as Demand for PCs Plunge](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-massive-layoffs-2022)  
Anton Shilov, Tom's Hardware  
"Intel to possibly cut workforce later this month."

## Process

[mastodon.technology Shutdown](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/)  
Ash Furrow  
This sucks. I'll be figuring out [how to migrate](https://codingitwrong.com/2022/10/10/migrating-a-mastodon-account.html) soon enough.

[Drug trafficking: Australia drug cartel investigations revealed in data hack](https://www.smh.com.au/national/secret-agents-targeting-drug-cartels-in-australia-exposed-in-data-hack-20221004-p5bmzg.html)  
Nigel Gladstone, The Sydney Morning Herald  
"A massive leak of classified government documents has exposed the identities and methods of secret agents working to stop major drug importations to Australia."

[Taiwan Security Bureau: No Need to Destroy TSMC's Fabs If China Invades](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/taiwan-security-bureau-no-need-to-destroy-tsmcs-fabs-if-china-invades)  
Anton Shilov, Tom's Hardware  
Even if China did end up taking over Taiwan and the many chip fabs on the island, they'd quickly run out of much needed supplies, parts, and hardware that would be or are already no longer available to the Chinese. Of course, the impact this would immediately have on the world would be utterly devastating.

[Don’t make databases available on the public internet](https://tailscale.com/blog/introducing-pgproxy/)  
David Anderson, Tailscale  
Kind of a no brainer but you'd be surprised at the ways you can solve this.

Paul Sawers, TechCrunch
"NocoDB is one of a number of startups to emerge on the scene with plans to usurp the mighty Airtable, with an open source foundation serving as a core selling point."

[What are the 4 Golden Signals for Monitoring Kubernetes?](https://isovalent.com/blog/post/what-are-the-4-golden-signals-for-monitoring-kubernetes/)

## DevOps'ish Tweet of the Week

[![@adamhjk on Twitter: "I think we are seeing a shift toward enterprise teams using more cloud platforms fully, rather than intermediaries. Multi-cloud as a strategy for a single app appears to be dead/dying. Instead it's "choose the right cloud for the application", based on what can be rearchitected")](https://shortcdn.com/devopsish/289-devopsish-post-of-the-week.webp)](https://twitter.com/adamhjk/status/1580241259376975872)
