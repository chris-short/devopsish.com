This week was REALLY hard. The past two weeks are the anniversary of the worst two week span of my life. In 2001, I was working like a dog at Langley AFB, VA. It was great work but the hours were LONG. With a normal shift, training, and other fun outside of work hours military things there was a lot going on. Then my grandmother died. Not earth shattering but it was another ratcheting up of the stress levels

Then I got very sick. I had to seek treatment in an ER after work one day for flu-like symptoms. September 7, 2001, the day after the ER visit, I learned one of my best friends had passed away overnight at the age of 20. I had recently seen him a couple of times the previous weeks between visits to UNC and him to Newport News, VA. On the way to the funeral, I completely broke down when passing the highway exit towards Chapel Hill, NC.

September 10th, we decided to overnight at my parent's house in Hickory, NC. The morning of 9⁄11, I had woken up early and watched the incidents break at WTC. By the time the Pentagon was hit, we were hauling ass back to Virginia. The emotions of the event led to a series of decisions that ultimately led to my injury that now causes me constant issues. The physical injury and damage to the psyche are permanent.

A visit with my psychiatrist this week led me to understand some things about dealing with the trauma of these events. We developed a plan to steel myself during this time of year.

The Ansible team was pushing hard to get Ansible Tower 3.3 ready to release this past Wednesday. I was also prepping a talk for the Grand Rapids Red Hat User Group. Julie's birthday is coming up and planning for that has been next to impossible to focus on. It's like all my buffers were full and throwing stuff to /dev/null at random. It was a lot to run with all at once. As I told someone, "Hard week personally, great week professionally."

There are three things I am now permanently marking in my calendar as recurring events. On the business day before 9/11, I will have an appointment with my psychiatrist. From 2019 to whenever my working life ends, I will be taking paid time off on the day of 9⁄11. This year I worked late helping tie up things before Hurrican Florence inundated Red Hat HQ. Towards the end of the day, I did have a moment or two to reflect on the day. Early in the day, I was anxious and nervous. I was easily distracted by simple things. My routine after lunch walk with my dog helped. I realized that I needed to lock down a few things then triage a few other before getting out of the office that day. The anxiety didn't fade. But, the distractions were gone.

I will also be blocking out the 5th through the 13th of September every year as "no public speaking" (and mindfully limited travel). I did okay in Grand Rapids but, it wasn't my best me. Anxieties of work, the history of the day, prepping and presenting a talk were  too much for me to perform at a level high enough to do myself justice.

I was going to write about [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/) this week. I have talked to several Microsoft folks about the product called DevOps. I have feelings and thoughts on the topic for sure. But, this felt more pertinent and has honestly been therapeutic to write. It might shock some people but, I'm human too. Thank you for reading. Stay safe out there.
