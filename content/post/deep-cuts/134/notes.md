## Containers Growing Up Fast

[Kubernetes and containers are growing up fast, survey shows | ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-and-containers-are-growing-up-fast-survey-shows/)

IT Ops is showing up to the party and wondering what happened to all the VMs. This article demonstrates to me that DevOps and container technologies might have leap frogged Ops. I think it was while I was writing What is DevOps that Emily Freeman, Nathen Harvey, and a few others had a call about this very topic. The concensus was, yes, we've left Operations behind in the march towards DevOps and on to the Cloud Native future.

## Danielle Morrill's Piece on Children

[Deciding to Be Child Free by Danielle Morrill](http://www.daniellemorrill.com/2019/06/deciding-to-be-child-free/)

Children, having them, raising them, etc. is a lot of work. There are enough of us now that we don't all have to reproduce to improve as a society. Danielle Morrill talks about her decision to not have kids in such a powerful way.

> "And I also began processing a lot of my own experiences as a child, my issues with my parents (most of us have some) and then… we sold Mattermark. I was totally free to write whatever new chapter of my life.
>
> Which was scary af but also awesome in the true meaning of the world. Full of awe. But also a void of meaning… and this is where it was so tempting to have a kid, to give my life meaning in the face of this yawning void of an unknown future.
>
> So I didn’t, because that seemed like a really unfair reason to make a new human."

Want to help make a change and reduce some pressure in someone's life? Stop asking newlyweds when they're going to have kids. People shouldn't have to explain when or why they have or don't have kids.

Deming said, "A bad system will beat a good person every time." Decisions were made, people died to reduce costs, and that is what we call negligence.

## ASF Changes

[Changes at the Apache Software Foundation [LWN.net]](https://lwn.net/Articles/791973/)

> "ASF Board accepted the resignations of Board Member Jim Jagielski, Chairman Phil Steitz, and Executive Vice President Ross Gardler last month."

An odd time to announce changes in such a grand way. But the cherry on top is that the ASF did not state the why behind the leadership change. I ended up doing a little digging.
