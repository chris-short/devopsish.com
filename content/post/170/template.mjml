          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>Everything is canceled, postponed, or going virtual. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has already made drastic impacts across the planet. Particularly this week, when several companies restricted travel forcing conferences to do something if they hadn&rsquo;t already. KubeCon EU is getting pushed back to July or August. I canceled my plans earlier in the week because, with everything up in the air, there&rsquo;s no telling I&rsquo;ll be available to participate whenever it does eventually get rescheduled. Since a lot of us are probably stuck at home, I&rsquo;d like to remind you, I&rsquo;m always looking for opportunities to sit down and talk to folks from my office. I&rsquo;ve got the setup for it and have a few upgrades in mind. If you have an idea for a conversation instead of a Meetup, panel, or talk, feel free to reach out. I&rsquo;m looking for collaborative opportunities.</p>

            Dumbest thing you can do in a crisis is double down on existing decisions. The next dumbest thing is to double down without being transparent about what work is in progress to reassess the situation.</p>

            Imagine how appalled I was when a coworker told me they had their town&rsquo;s first coronavirus victim identified on the local news. It was with consent as part of a public health announcement but, that has to be a pretty dire situation (like coronavirus).</p>

            What&rsquo;s wrong with software speed, quality, and cost? Oxford-based AI company Diffblue surveyed 300 developers to find out what the people who actually work with code have to say about testing, their pain points, and what&rsquo;s holding back DevOps in their organizations. <em>SPONSORED</em></p>

            &ldquo;Container Attached Storage enables Kubernetes users to treat storage entities as microservices. CAS has two elements — the control plane and the data plane. The control plane is deployed as a set of Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) that deal with the low-level storage entities. The data plane runs as a collection of Pods close to the workload.&rdquo;</p>

            &ldquo;The pity is that Facebook is not going to create an open source version of the Tupperware cluster and container controller, or the new Delos storage service that is underpinning the current iteration of the control plane in Tupperware, both of which were discussed at Facebook&rsquo;s System @scale event late last week.&rdquo;</p>
