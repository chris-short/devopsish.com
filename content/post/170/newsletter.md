Everything is canceled, postponed, or going virtual. Coronavirus (COVID-19) has already made drastic impacts across the planet. Particularly this week when several companies restricted travel forcing conferences to do something if they hadn't already. KubeCon EU is getting pushed back to July or August. I cancelled my plans earlier in the week because to be honest, with everything up in the air, there's no telling I'll be available to participate whenever it does eventually get rescheduled to. With that being said, I'm always looking for opportunities to sit down and talk to folks from my office. I've got the setup for it and have a few upgrades in mind. If you have an idea for a conversation in lieu of a Meetup, panel or talk, feel free to reach out. I'm looking for opportunities.
