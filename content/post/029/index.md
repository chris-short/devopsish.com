My first full week working as Manager, DevOps at Bankrate.com in Downtown Detroit was great! There is an amazing transformation happening here in Detroit. I foresee Detroit becoming a huge tech hub and DevOps center of gravity in the not too distant future. If you are interested in joining this effort and building a world class DevOps team at Bankrate.com [I am looking to fill one more DevOps Engineer position](http://app.jobvite.com/m?3ru8KiwA) on my team at the moment.

I also had the pleasure of hearing [Baruch Sadogursky](https://twitter.com/jbaruch) from [JFrog](https://www.jfrog.com/) talk about [DevOps Transformation](https://www.jfrog.com/shownotes/devops-scale-greek-tragedy-3-acts-devops-detroit/) at [DevOps Detroit](https://www.meetup.com/DevOps-Detroit/). The talk had a great theme (Greek tragedies) and walked through the stereotypical DevOps greenfield scenario. Two things Baruch said really stood out to me. "Pain is instructional." It is very unlikely you are going to go from startup to Google/Facebook/Netflix in the span of a few weeks, months, or years. The growing pains that will be unique to your organization and applications are incredibly helpful in guiding you towards your goals.

Baruch also addressed the DevOps as a job title or department in a way that resonated with me, "DevOps Engineers are DevOps enablers in their organizations." This is so true! When DevOps tries to be the entire organization's culture from day one it will fail. You have to get some buy-in and start. The whole organization will transform iteratively in small, manageable pieces (just like in our workflows). I have come to learn that DevOps is as much about patience as it is speed and flow.

Serverless is very real, folks.

[Crunchy Container Suite](https://github.com/CrunchyData/crunchy-containers) provides Docker containers that enable rapid deployment of PostgreSQL, including administration and monitoring tools. Multiple styles of deploying PostgreSQL clusters are supported.

I feel like this might serve me well in the near future: [Deploying .NET Application on Docker & Kubernetes](https://hackernoon.com/deploying-net-application-on-docker-kubernetes-21ae85273827)

[Julien Vehent](https://twitter.com/jvehent) is writing a book I find rather intriguing: [Securing DevOps](https://www.manning.com/books/securing-devops) has been in production for almost a year and is expected to be released this fall.

Jeff Geerling went on an Ansible writing tear this week! [Updating all your servers with Ansible](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/updating-all-your-servers-ansible) and [Mount an AWS EFS filesystem on an EC2 instance with Ansible](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/mount-aws-efs-filesystem-on-ec2-instance-ansible) are both great reads.

On Wednesday we all woke up and rejoiced when we learned [Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Resigns as C.E.O.](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick.html) Then we all sat there shaking our heads when we learned [Uber employees are circulating a petition to ask the board to let Travis Kalanick return](https://www.recode.net/2017/6/22/15855174/uber-employees-petition-travis-kalanick-return).

I studied Buddhism as a child ([long story](https://chrisshort.net/center-for-purposeful-living/)) and found this piece from [Faisal Hoque](https://medium.com/@faisal_hoque) via [Hackernoon](https://medium.com/@hackernoon) to be quite a nice reminder: [Buddha Had It Right: Relax The Mind And Productivity Will Follow](https://hackernoon.com/buddha-had-it-right-relax-the-mind-and-productivity-will-follow-f2e21b1ef928)
