It's one of our rare long weekends here in the US. I'm trying really hard to have a good time and not ruin any great moments. There's a lot I could be doing but, I'm holding off to help recharge. I hope you are taking a similar break is you're able. A lot of good stuff in the works here for you. First, DevOps'ish has teamed up with [O'Reilly](https://devopsi.sh/safarionline) to provide discounts on all manner of O'Reilly content, books, ebooks, events, and more. More good things will come as a result of this partnership (stay tuned).
