If you follow me on Twitter you know it has been a [roller](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1498810564751118344) [coaster](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1499352858017341440) week on the home front. I was getting a haircut today and a topic that I often hear lately is how terrible doctor‚Äôs are of late about informing folks of bad news. Our family went from [thinking the absolute worst](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1498810564751118344) as laid out by doctors one afternoon. Only to have a doc twelve hours later tell us, [no, everything is fine](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort/status/1499352858017341440) (Yay! ü•≥). We‚Äôll do this one test to prove it. We‚Äôre very confident this is a false positive. A friend of mine and I talk about this phenomenon from time to time. But, even my barber had a friend that had the news he had 4-6 years to live and the doctor said, ‚ÄúYeah. You better start checking off that bucket list.‚Äù Why has this become common place? This  somewhat inhuman behavior has to be being taught somehow for it to be so widespread one would think. I get it, telling people they might have to deal with the death of a loved one is hard. But, let‚Äôs rattle off all scenarios not just the death one. *pat on the shoulder*

Also, if you use Amazon EKS, I have a new newsletter called [**EKS News**](https://eks.news/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=258&utm_campaign=devopsish).

**Editor's note**: I cannot ignore the war being waged in Europe. But, this newsletter is a tech newsletter. Generally, the audience responds negatively to "political" news. But, one person's politics, is another person's life. All the [Ukraine news](https://devopsish.com/259/notes/#ukraine) is here in the notes. Don't if you don't want to see it. [**Skip it**](https://devopsish.com/259/notes/#notes)!

[Gender discrimination at fintech startup, Fast](https://www.tessakriesel.com/gender-discrimination-at-fintech-startup-fast/)  
Twitter friend Tessa Kriesel is the victim of what appears to be a regular occurrence in the tech industry. Here's a month (often more) of pay to stay quiet and walk away. Let me tell you, secrets will eat you alive but, I still think open secrets are worse. Open secrets are a toxin and quite poisoning at the scale of the tech industry. Case in point, [this CEO](https://twitter.com/DOMM) was already on my 'Bad Actor' list. This story was also featured on [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/fast-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-former-employee-2022-2).

[Silenced No More Act: Washington passes the bill](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/washington-silenced-no-more)  
The NDAs I've signed over the years would be incredibly hard to prove but, quite easy to start expensive litigation over. I'd want to read the text of any law like this coming to Michigan but, I think I could get behind this effort.

[Intel CEO Attends State of the Union as Biden Pushes Chips Act](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-ceo-state-of-the-union-chips-act)  
That is a pretty serious ask of a President to reach out to a key CEO to help with a policy initiative.

[Low Process Culture, High Process Culture](https://cate.blog/2022/02/28/low-process-culture-high-process-culture/)
"My boss gave me a helpful piece of advice. He told me that if I knew what to do, I should just do it, and then fit the process to it. It helped a lot."

[Introducing Ballast: An Adaptive Load Test Framework](https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ballast-an-adaptive-load-test-framework/)  
"With this in mind, we developed Ballast, an adaptive load test framework that leverages traffic capture using [Berkeley Packet Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter) (BPF) and replays the traffic using a [PID Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller) mechanism to adjust the number of requests per second (RPS) to each service."
