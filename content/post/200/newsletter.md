The first full work week of the year has already been filled with news. But, Monday saw a Slack outage, Wednesday saw an insurrection in the US, and there is a new twist in the [Solarwinds supply chain compromise](https://devopsish.com/solarwinds-supply-chain-compromise/). We'll discuss two of these topics and more.

[URGENT: SECURITY: New maintainer is probably malicious · Issue #1263 · greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263)  
"TLDR: The old maintainer appears to have sold the extension to parties unknown, who have malicious intent to exploit the users of this extension in advertising fraud, tracking, and more. In v7.1.8 of the extension (published to the web store but NOT to GitHub), arbitrary code was executed from a remote server, which appeared to be used to commit a variety of tracking and fraud actions. After Microsoft removed it from Edge for malware, v7.1.9 was created without this code: however, it can be added back at any time, and the original maintainer remains in control."
