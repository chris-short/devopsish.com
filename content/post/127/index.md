Happy Mother's Day! To the single moms, this day should be yours two times over. I'm sorry if you don't even get so much as a bathroom break to yourself today. To the almost moms, this day is yours. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise; if they do, send them my way. To the moms that have lost a child, this day is especially yours. For those of us whose toxic moms have been extricated from our lives, this day might be a little heavier. That's okay too; do what you need to do. No one says you can't celebrate someone else's awesome mom either. For example, Emily Freeman's mom is the human embodiment of DevOps, honor her. Regardless, I hope everyone has a marvelous Mother's Day.

[What is DevOps](https://devopsish.com/what-is-devops/) — "If forced to put it in one sentence, I would describe DevOps as follows: 'DevOps is the professional practice of frequent, continued, and iterative improvements through measurable changes, the goal of which is to become a high-velocity organization thus improving business outcomes.'"
