This week was both physically and mentally challenging. With a heavy heart, I bring you the news of [Cody Crudgington's passing on Tuesday night](https://twitter.com/AlexB138/status/1574590750288920599) in his home. The [Kubernetes Contributor Comms Team](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication/marketing-team/README.md) sprang into action on behalf of Kubernetes Steering this week to get coordinated around who to open up communication lanes with and generally being as open with the community as possible while respecting the wishes of Cody's family. As I wrote on the [CNCF Memorial for Cody](https://github.com/cncf/memorials/blob/main/cody-crudgington.md), he and I had some unique similarities, and he was willing to drop whatever he was doing to help folks in need. Cody was loved in the Kubernetes community for his positivity and optimism. The [K8sContributor thread on Wednesday](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors/status/1574809587785601024) is filled with an outpouring of love and admiration. He truly will be missed.

Follow [K8sContributors on Twitter](https://twitter.com/K8sContributors) or the [k-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev) for any additional details. We will be doing a memorial at KubeCon for Cody. I will put those event details in this newsletter once I have them. I've reached out to those coordinating to let them know I'm here to help (especially since I'm local).

I know in these times we all want to do something to help. For the moment, check out the links mentioned here and stand by for further information as it becomes available.

Remember, any news that **I** add to my info sharing "Firehouse" will land in the [/r/devopsish](https://www.reddit.com/r/devopsish/) subreddit almost immediately, then [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChrisShort) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thechrisshort/) eventually.
