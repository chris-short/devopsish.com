In dark times, there are typically rays of light that can be found to give us hope. I read an article last weekend that I thought would be worth mentioning here this week. [*Will the coronavirus crisis, like Sars, give birth to the next big thing in China tech?*](https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3073961/will-coronavirus-crisis-sars-give-birth-next-big-thing-china-tech) looks at how the Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com got their start during the SARS crisis of 2002-2003. The coronavirus caused markets tanked this week but, US banks had plenty of liquidity from the Federal Reserve and capital on hand thanks to regulations passed after the 2008 financial crisis. A global outbreak of this nature will have a significant economic impact. But, here will be some good that comes from this current crisis. One possible example is that a few companies have halted stock buybacks. [Stopping stock buybacks might do some good for the economy](https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-stock-buybacks-are-dangerous-for-the-economy) as companies maintain capital that can be invested in things that will be more impactful during this trying time. [Use your time effectively like Iassc Newton](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/03/12/during-pandemic-isaac-newton-had-work-home-too-he-used-time-wisely/) did. You might not invent calculus or theories for gravity and motion but, the time you save from commuting might be able to be put to some good use. Keep your heads up.

Note: Starting this week, I'm stopping all e-mail click and open tracking. After 170 weeks of doing this, if I don't know what you want to read by now, I'm not doing a good job. This change will impact marketing efforts, but your privacy matters more to me. The only metric I have left to give to potential sponsors is subscribers. Do this newsletter a favor and help it grow.

"Academics disclose new Collide+Probe and Load+Reload attacks on AMD CPUs."

[Intel CPUs vulnerable to new LVI attacks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-cpus-vulnerable-to-new-lvi-attacks/)  
"Researchers say Intel processors will need another round of silicon chip re-designs to protect against new attack."

Not all managed Kubernetes services are created the same. They support different features and options for their cluster control planes and nodes, and they vary in how much management they really provide. To help cut through the fog, StackRox performed a hands-on, side-by-side comparison of the top three services (EKS, AKS, GKE) to help you understand the current state of these services and the trade-offs between them. *SPONSORED*

## Tools

[What makes a good Operator?](https://blog.openshift.com/what-makes-a-good-operator/)  
One Operator per managed application, one controller per custom resource definition, and do not hard-code namespaces or resources names are some pretty basic guidelines but, there are many other good bits folks should try to stick to (or at least be aware of the compromises you might be making).

[Managed Kubernetes Price Comparison (2020)](https://devopsdirective.com/posts/2020/03/managed-kubernetes-comparison/)  
"TL;DR: Azure and Digital Ocean don't charge for the compute resources used for the control plane, making AKS and DO the cheapest for running many, smaller clusters. For running fewer, larger clusters GKE is the most affordable option."

[Open Policy Agent's Mission to Secure the Cloud](https://thenewstack.io/open-policy-agents-mission-to-secure-the-cloud/)  
"OPA is an open-source tool that enables the enforcement of a wide range of policies across domains and all layers in the stack. This policy engine supplies users with greater control over their environment while eliminating the need to write a different policy language, API, or model for each product and service."

[USB Keystroke Injection Protection](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/03/usb-keystroke-injection-protection.html)  
"To make the life of an attacker harder, we propose a tool that measures the timing of incoming keystrokes and determines if it is an attack based on predefined heuristics (without a user being involved in the decision)."
