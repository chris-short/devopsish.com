[Why I Turned Down an AWS Job Offer](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/why-i-turned-down-an-aws-job-offer/) — The illustrious Corey Quinn and I share at least one thing in common; neither one of us approves of non-compete policies. I think that any employer, AWS in particular, attempting to enact a non-compete is pretty gross. In my opinion, attempting to enforce a non-compete is professional bullying. AWS should indeed be better than this.
