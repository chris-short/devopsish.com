The US Revolution was literally fought over stuff like this. It goes against the very fabric of freedom to aid in the creation of a wholly censored internet. It is highly likely that Chinese teenagers likely have no idea that [something happened in 1989](/104/china-89.pdf) that led to the putting down of over 10,000 people.
