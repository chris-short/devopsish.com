AWS re:Invent was this week. I put a whole section in the notes this week for y'all all about [AWS re:Invent](/246/notes/). There were a lot of cool announcements this week. There was a scenario was I was going to be there. But, family was getting COVID-19 vaccines the Sunday before, I had doctor's appointments, and it wasn't meant to be. Thank the Maker I didn't end up going. This week has been a nightmare, wrapped in worry, with a big dose of impostor syndrome on top, and I caught a cold too.

First, there were multiple family crises. At one point in time my sole focus was on two of my nephews because we needed to watch them at one point with an extra dose of sunshine. Really glad I was here to help and support. Then [part of a terror plot unfolded](https://www.wxyz.com/news/oxford-school-shooting/prosecutor-details-disturbing-warning-signs-and-events-that-led-up-to-the-oxford-high-school-shooting) in our front yards. This story is really sad, bad, and preventable. A lot of people failed in their responsibilities and people are dead as a result. It's a truly horrible situation. Max was home from school for two days this week. Again, glad I was here to help and support. I think everyone in the know was definitely pegged out on the stress meter. Normally, I turn to work to help distract me from stress but, I'm still forming my path. That's when the impostor syndrome set in (because that's a totally normal reaction). Thankfully, [this video helped with the impostor syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz8F9YT4axA). I got the ship righted by Friday. But, wow... This week has been something else.

[Knative Has Applied to Become a CNCF Incubating Project](https://knative.dev/blog/steering/knative-cncf-donation/)  
This was quite the course correction. I had to flat out ask [Chris Dibona what brought about this change](https://twitter.com/cdibona/status/1465754668450025473). I got an answer. I'm not sure I'm buying it just yet. Time will tell. If Knative wants in, I welcome them with open arms. I wish they would have made that decision without the WTF moment that drove good people away from the project.
