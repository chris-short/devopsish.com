          <p style="font-weight: bold">Welcome!</p>
          <p>I spent this week in Las Vegas, working at IBM&rsquo;s FastStart 2020 event. The event is for IBM sellers, partners, and technical folks to come to learn the new bits of knowledge about the products they&rsquo;re selling and enabling at their clients&rsquo; sites. I went in my usual technical capacity and learned very quickly IBM and Red Hat speak two different languages. This is expected but, I wanted to look a little further into the why behind that. As a surprise to no one, I found a DevOps parallel here.</p>

          <p>In DevOps, change starts one of two ways based on the type of change happening. The more natural way (for me) is to start with the teams with their hands on the keyboard doing the work. Talk to them about their problems in their language. Tell them how your tool&rsquo;s features help to solve their problems. Pull out a laptop and prove to them you&rsquo;re not full of shit. This is the bottom-up approach to DevOps. It&rsquo;s an engineer built and run transformation. Leadership stakeholders are updated about results. Leadership buys-in because the results prove themselves.</p>

          <p>The other approach to change I&rsquo;ve seen is a top-down approach. This is often implemented poorly at first, from the engineer&rsquo;s point of view. It&rsquo;s often implemented as an edict from on high making what appears to be an ill-informed decision. This approach works well when an agreement that change is necessary is reached beforehand. It&rsquo;s also a great approach when the corporate culture is fantastic. Yes, I&rsquo;ve seen it done as an executive driven decision with mass firing and all the trimmings. That approach rarely goes well.</p>

          <p>IBM uses a top-down approach to sales and enablement because it has established trust with its clients. This trust is very much with the top of the org chart, though. An engineer and developer-first world full of projects and tools the IBM crowd has never seen or even heard of before is foreign. This world is also eating into the IBM world. If Red Hat and IBM establish a new common language and figure out our collective strengths together, watch out.</p>

            An argument against Discord for use with open source and public interest projects. The privacy and censorship point of view is one I appreciate but, a lot of the arguments could be made about a lot of communication systems in use today, not only Discord (namely IRC and Slack).</p>

            The HP/Xerox saga continues. I&rsquo;m starting to wonder when Xerox runs out of clock on this. There has to be some critical reason(s) Xerox&rsquo;s board sees this as it&rsquo;s future. Eventually, investors are going to want this work to pay off. If it never materializes, which seems more and more likely, then what Xerox?</p>

Everything in open source is based on a degree of trust.</p>

            Debt is a tool. But, managing that debt is vital. Letting debt manage you leads to horrible things. I&rsquo;m talking about money here but, your org&rsquo;s codebases might be old enough to be at this level of impact too. But, much like you had to learn some money management terms to navigate the financial world, you&rsquo;ll have to adopt new language to get management to understand the need to manage this tech debt sooner rather than later.</p>
