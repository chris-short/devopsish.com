Every time, without fail, I mention anything resembling a political leaning in this newsletter I get negative feedback. This week, I am sure I will again. But, this message is personal so I’ve made it simple. **VOTE**.

I don’t care what your stances on the issues are, whether you care if a pot-smoking gay couple can be photographers at your cousin’s wedding, nor what you think of these weird things that are happening on the planet. I only want you to **VOTE**.

I gave up a huge part of my existence helping others enable voting in foreign countries because US citizens voted to put my team there. Afghanistan voted today in parliamentary elections. [People died in Afghanistan to vote today](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-45919057). Brazil, Fiji, Ireland, Israel, Taiwan, and the United States have elections coming up this year. All I want is when it is your time, **VOTE**.
