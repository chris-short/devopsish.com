This is the 52nd issue of [**DevOps'ish**](https://devopsish.com/)! While the official one-year anniversary is next week, there are 52 weeks in a year and now is as good a time as any to celebrate. In keeping with DevOps best practices, I shared some lessons learned in, [Notes on Running a Newsletter: A Year of DevOps'ish](https://chrisshort.net/notes-on-running-a-newsletter-a-year-of-devopsish/).

To celebrate the DevOps'ish first anniversary, Kris Nova has graciously offered to sponsor a giveaway of her and Justin Garrison's new book, [*Cloud Native Infrastructure*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920075837.do). If you want to be entered to win, please complete the [DevOps'ish Diversity Form](https://goo.gl/forms/aVCS0AVwIyLouV1p2) for consideration. Winners will be announced in next week's newsletter!

Looking back the five most popular issues of DevOps'ish have been:

1. [DevOps'ish 035: Google's Toxicity, Security, SRE, Kubernetes, and More!](/035/)
2. [DevOps'ish 045: Sick Days, Kubernetes, Kaspersky, Go, AWS, and More!](/045/)
3. [DevOps'ish 040: Solaris, Observability, Shift Left, Ansible, and More](/040/)
4. [DevOps'ish 037: Google, Debian, MongoDB, Kubernetes, and More!](/037/)
5. [DevOps'ish Weekly â€” 014: Week of 1489294800](/014/)

Thanks for making the first year of running this newsletter so awesome. I hope the next year will be even more amazing!

In personal news, thanks to the generosity of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, I will be attending [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2017](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-and-cloudnativecon-north-america)! If you're in Austin Dec 5th through 9th, be sure to send me a note or stop me for some new and improved DevOps'ish stickers.
