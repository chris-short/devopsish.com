[How DevOps is like auto racing](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/08/22/how-devops-is-like-auto-racing/) — "When I talk about desired outcomes or answer a question about where to get started with any part of a DevOps initiative, I like to mention NASCAR or Formula 1 racing." Excerpts from this piece were used in [How to explain DevOps in plain English](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/8/devops-explained-plain-english).

[The 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps: Elite performance, productivity, and scaling](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-2019-accelerate-state-of-devops-elite-performance-productivity-and-scaling)

## Tools

[Command Line Heroes Season 3: The Infrastructure Effect](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes/season-3/the-infrastructure-effect) — "COBOL was a giant leap for computers to make industries more efficient. Chris Short describes how learning COBOL was seen as a safe long-term bet. Sixty years later, there are billions of lines of COBOL code that can't easily be replaced—and few specialists who know the language. Ritika Trikha explains that something must change: Either more people must learn COBOL, or the industries that rely on it have to update their codebase. Both choices are difficult. But the future isn't being written in COBOL. Today's IT infrastructure is built in the cloud—and a lot of it is written in Go. Carmen Hernández Andoh shares how Go's designers wanted a language more suited for the cloud. And Kelsey Hightower points out that languages are typically hyper-focused for one task. But they're increasingly open and flexible."

[Git Cheatsheet](http://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html) — This interactive Git cheatsheet could get you out of a jam. It might even teach us a thing or two.
