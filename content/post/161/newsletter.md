Thank you to each and every one of you. The fact you subscribe to something I write and hopefully gain something from fuels my fire. In 2020, expect some changes, like always, as DevOps'ish is iterated on more and more. I hope to continue to provide the right information, to the right people at the right time. I have a question for all DevOps'ish readers though. If I were to choose a charity to donate a portion of all proceeds from sponsorships to, what would it be? Please [use this form to make a suggestion](https://devopsi.sh/charity_suggest?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=161). Thank you very much!

[**Sponsor DevOps'ish**](https://devopsi.sh/prospectus?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=161)  
The cost of maintaining this newsletter and the associated social media streams is not zero. At the very least it is an enourmous investment of time. Sponsoring DevOps'ish provides brand recognition and engagement from readers across the globe. The native ad format makes sure your message gets seen. Read the [prospectus](https://devopsi.sh/prospectus?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=161) then email me at [chris@devopsish.com](mailto:chris@devopsish.com) to get started today!

DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is being held to give people a place to get deeper technical information about Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). Our goal isn't to just tell you to "do the technical thing"; it is to show you real world examples of how others have done it. DELIVERY|CONF 2020 is a not-for-profit event being created by an all-volunteer team with many years of experience both in the technology and with creating conferences.

Detroit, MI

This is the first Software Developer Conference with a 100% focus on Black and Brown software developers. All sessions will be led by developers and will contain an actual code walk-thru. All presenters have a 3 slide limit and everything else has to be code. We have a Happy Hour after the conference where you can network and mingle with other developers. The profits from the conference will go to funding Detroit Black Tech initiatives and events.

[Can Embedded Clustering Kill Kubernetes?](https://www.titanoboa.io/cluster.html) — Perhaps pulling the pieces of Kubernetes that are actually needed directly into your code base is a better approach. It isn't practical today but, I could see a future where a component of K8s is embedded in the app as opposed to the cluster itself. It's an interesting thought piece at the very least.

[Grafana Series Part 2: Monitoring a UPS with Grafana on Linux](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2018/11/15/monitoring-a-ups-with-grafana-on-linux/) — A faulty UPS ever bite you? I've had them blow up in my face before. Sure is nice to have UPS metrics so that you can find anomolous ones.
