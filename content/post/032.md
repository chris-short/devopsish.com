I attended [GopherCon](https://gophercon.com/) in Denver this week (and [visited System 76's Denver office](https://twitter.com/system76/status/885951487284621312)). It was an unbelievably positive experience. [I attended as a diversity scholarship recipient](https://medium.com/@GolangBridge/welcome-to-our-gophercon-2017-diversity-scholarship-winners-afcced449ba2) (being a partially disabled veteran has *one *perk). I had friends there and met up with them the first day I was in town (I made a lot more friends as the week went on). I got to meet the wonderful Sarah Adams from [Women Who Go](http://www.womenwhogo.org/) at a welcome breakfast at Modern Market the first day of the conference. Sarah is an incredible person and her personality put me at ease. Sarah showed me that I was among friends at GopherCon. The conference organizers are the most down to earth and nicest people you could ever meet. Dave Cheney and I talked over breakfast one morning about the premise of my Lightning Talk and how *crypto/tls *in the Go standard library, "just works." I have never been hugged at a conference before but I got quite a few hugs at GopherCon. The Go community is a truly great thing to be a part of.

Russ Cox laid out the case for, "not abandoning Go 1." Russ also turned on my thought bubbles around the idea of [Experience Reports](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/ExperienceReports). Kris Nova gave a refreshing talk about *rm -rf'*ing* *a cumbersome piece of a project and starting over*.* I watched in amazement as Liz Rice built a strace tool in Go from scratch (and now I want to know everything about [ptrace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html)). But, the highlight of the conference talks came from Ashley McNamara. She gave a heartfelt keynote that brought members of the audience to tears (I got goosebumps). The Go community cheered her on as she began to choke up on stage discussing her journey to Go. This was a very moving keynote and it was Ashley's first one (no pressure for the next one, Smash). It was a truly great time and I think I made some very good friends and met more people than I ever thought possible. From Estonia and Cameroon to Japan and Australia; the globe is covered in half a million Go developers and 1,500 were in Denver with me.

You might have noticed last week that I changed up the [DevOps'ish](https://devopsish.com) weekly headlines from an epoch to a description of what's in the newsletter. This week, I am ditching the whimsical and creative section heads and consolidating into my [DevOps Three Things](https://speakerdeck.com/chrisshort/a-night-of-devops?slide=21). This will simplify the weekly creation process for the sake of speed.
