KubeCon hangover is real. I grossly overestimated how much I'd be able to do in four days of course. I spent my little break between jobs actually trying to sleep in. Spend extra time with Max (daddy pick ups from school are a real thing now). But, any time I went to do something technical or constructive, it took a lot longer than I thought it would. I did a lot of little niceties to [various websites](https://chrisshort.net/projects/), pre-employment stuff, write the $newjob blog post, and generally not think about complex things. There was a list of little projects I wanted to tinker with but, I opted to maybe read or play Madden instead. It wasn't bad, but to say I'm recovered for KubeCon is an gross overestimation. I'm going to shut myself in and lay on heating packs all day tomorrow more than likely. Two bad ankles, a bone spur in the neck, and a bad shoulder all snarling at you doesn't make for a good time.
