An old headline rears its ugly head again this week. The company that now owns the remnants of [The SCO Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish) (whose claim to fame was [going bankrupt in suing Linux distro makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_SCO%E2%80%93Linux_disputes?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish) until their dying breath), Xinuos, has decided to try this strategy out for itself in hopes of a different outcome. [Xinuos is suing IBM and Red Hat](https://www.xinuos.com/xinuos-sues-ibm-and-red-hat/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish) for using Linux.

Talk about bringing back ancient memories of trying to keep up with a new and essential thing to me back in the early 2000s: Linux. Back then, getting your hands on Linux was a challenge, and Linux users were easy marks, according to SCO. Back in those days, [SCO even said it would go after individual end-users](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2666717/sco-to-sue-linux-user.html?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish). While it made Linux seem a little untrustworthy at the time to the outsider, insiders knew this was all bullshit. IBM was doubling and tripling down on Linux, and Red Hat was a public company. Yes, there felt like a potential disaster could happen with one lousy court ruling. But that day never came. It was a wilder world back then.

Now Xinuos looks to walk in The SCO Group‚Äôs bankruptcy-inducing tactics or threaten and harass Linux users. We knew better and told SCO to pound sand way back then. Twenty years removed, with history repeating itself, all I can do now is laugh. Really hard too. [Xinuos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinuos?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish)? Who? Lulz. Good luck on your journey to being the next ‚Äú[Most Hated Company In Tech.](https://lwn.net/Articles/67886/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=devopsish)‚Äù

[Update on campaign targeting security researchers](https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/update-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/)  
This is intense and a very complicated campaign designed to look increasingly convincing to someone that can't connect all the dots like Google, Microsoft, or Facebook could. Keep your cover out there.

Do you find that your engineers spend too much time creating and maintaining staging environments and yet, there never seems to be enough environments to go around? A shortage of environments is a top driver of low developer productivity and often impacts an engineering team's ability to ship features on time. With Release, you can get a full instance of your app with all of its services with every pull request. You'll never have to wait around for staging environments again. üí° [Get started now](https://releaseapp.io/?utm_source=devopsish&utm_medium=email&utm_content=get-started&utm_campaign=20210228) üí° *SPONSORED*

In which AWS apologizes for acting like a really shitty company to work at but, "We apologize to Representative Pocan." That's it?!?! This is really bad PR followed by worse PR. I still can't believe how many AWS employees I've had to elbow this week to not carry the company message on this one.
