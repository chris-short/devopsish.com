Welcome!

DevOps'ish is back. What did the hiatus look like? Why did it need to happen at all?

Like fixing an airplane while it's in-flight, It's hard assessing a problem while you're in the middle of creating it. COVID-19 is just the sort of thing that turned the world just upside down enough that I needed to take a break to reassess how to do the newsletter, in general. Meanwhile, sponsorships completely dried up (for five weeks). The incentive I created for myself to write the newsletter when things were hard was literally gone two weeks after my family started sheltering. The world was in chaos, my processes weren't aligned to the new state of things, and incentives were gone. When you couple that with a very big project that I was undertaking at work (and literally spending all my free time researching); the newsletter had to "fall off the plate" as it were. My medical world got turned upside down too because of COVID-19. I was rightfully put on hold for routine treatment so the medical infrastructure could adjust too. If my doctors are taking a break from my treatments, I don't stand a chance at functioning at 100%. I feel like that's simple to understand. If you disagree, feel free to email me.

Why is DevOps'ish back now?
