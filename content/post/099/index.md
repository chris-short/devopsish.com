This was an incredibly busy week in tech news and events. First, [AllThingsOpen](https://allthingsopen.org/) was this week. For me, this included the annual [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/) Moderators meeting in Red Hat Tower. The conference was amazing but, I feel like it might have outgrown the Raleigh Convention Center. 4,100 people registered to attend AllThingsOpen and I'm pretty sure half of them tried to get to two talks I wasn't able to attend due to crowds. I got to spend and even monopolize time with some truly amazing folks. If you were at AllThingsOpen and we weren't able to connect my deepest apologies.

GitHub had two significant outages this week that are discussed later. It's amazing to me how technology professionals treat these complex services they use every day as if they're air, water, and light. If you think running your code is hard, imagine how much harder it is to run the thing your code relies on. GitHub's week definitely ended on a high note though. The "[Microsoft acquisition of GitHub is complete. ðŸŽ‰](https://blog.github.com/2018-10-26-github-and-microsoft/)"

Google admitted to [giving golden handshakes to folks on their way out the door while keeping silent about misconduct claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html). This is a horrendous display of stereotypical tech culture from a company that once marketed itself as the exact opposite of. As I asked on Twitter:

{{< tweet 1055800303264677888 >}}

More details and reaction regarding Google's gross behavior follows (they're also doing some shady things with hiring too). I'm considering abandoning as many Google products as I can get away with at this point (and this is after pretty much moving all my cloud resources over to Google Cloud).

SQLite is making light of Code of Conducts [by using its own Code of Conduct to mock them](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/10/22/sqlite_code_of_conduct/). Then after a ton of blowback from the community, that original Code of Conduct was renamed to [Code of Ethics of the Project Founder](https://sqlite.org/codeofethics.html) and SQLite has adopted a [new Code of Conduct](https://sqlite.org/codeofconduct.html), the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines.

This is on top of beefing up the DevOps'ish [Terms of Service](/terms/), implementing a [Privacy Policy](/privacy/) at the request of a possible reader, tweaking the production process for the newsletter to keep it from getting too long, [working a full-time job](https://www.ansible.com/blog/author/chris-short), and [being a dad](http://bit.ly/2qd1jPJ).
