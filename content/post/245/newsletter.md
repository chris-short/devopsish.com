["PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIMPLIFY THIS CODE. KEEP THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLYING."](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/5a81905f772c28dc4c8f5d2cb2e5bfc48c422f41/pkg/controller/volume/persistentvolume/pv_controller.go): This almost 2000 lines of code that make up the [persistent volume controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/) was one of the most popular social media posts this week:

{{< highlight go "linenos=table,hl_lines=3-4,linenostart=58" >}}
 
// ==================================================================
// PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIMPLIFY THIS CODE.
// KEEP THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLYING.
// ==================================================================
//
// This controller is intentionally written in a very verbose style. You will
// notice:
//
// 1. Every 'if' statement has a matching 'else' (exception: simple error
//    checks for a client API call)
// 2. Things that may seem obvious are commented explicitly
//
// We call this style 'space shuttle style'. Space shuttle style is meant to
// ensure that every branch and condition is considered and accounted for -
// the same way code is written at NASA for applications like the space
// shuttle.
//
{{< / highlight >}}

Two things struck me about this comment:

1. The two times NASA was arrogant or, at the time, clever and thought it knew better (Space Shuttles Challenger and Columbia), those crews didn't come home alive. The pressure of a human or a team or an administration (NASA) not succeeding at their best guess outweighed the lives of those people on those spacecraft (sorry, grew up in Florida, might have been close to the shuttle program later in life, I have strong opinions). This Space Shuttle philosophy embarked in the code here also falls in line with the ye ole developers mantra, "[Clear is better than clever](https://dave.cheney.net/2019/07/09/clear-is-better-than-clever?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=237&utm_campaign=devopsish&utm_term=hi+dave&utm_content=love+chris)."
1. I happened to know some folks involved in contributing this code. So I asked questions.

In the early days of Kubernetes, persistent volumes (the Achilles heel of a container orchestrator being state and all) weren't considered reliable. This made widespread adoption of Kubernetes (state being the lifeblood of businesses worldwide and all) was pretty dependent on this feature workings.

In 2016, some Kubernetes contributors were locked in a room. Eventually, they all agreed. They needed to be sure that every use case was covered. No matter what, even if it was a no-op, EVERY USE CASE had to be covered. Naturally, PRs came in from people that wanted to help. People tried to simplify the code. But, there was something about the approach taken, the process behind the code, that needed to be codified. So it was written, "PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO SIMPLIFY THIS CODE. KEEP THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLYING."

[Don't soften feedback](https://larahogan.me/blog/dont-soften-feedback/)  
"Managers: it’s your responsibility to clearly (and kindly) articulate what’s expected of your teammates in their roles, and what the gaps are. If you avoid being direct—even if it sucks to do so, on top of everything else happening in the world!—you’re setting them up for failure." You really are. I had to get shaken pretty hard at the beginning of the pandemic.

[How COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Work - Vaccine Makers Project on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/579667076)  
I found this video highly informative. Reading it on paper, it is harder to think out the process of having the body take in mRNA. This makes the immune system's custodial chain of that Nobel Prize winning technology pretty clear.

Another reason why you shouldn't set your password policy to something shorter than a quantum safe number of characters. Sidenote: I can't believe dealing with quantum safe security is something I'm going to deal with in my life time. Didn't see that one coming but, looks like it will be.

1. Short-lived certificates mean you need to re-sign your software artifacts constantly
1. Sigstore doesn’t support revocation
1. Sigstore is only for signing and verifying containers!
1. The transparency log means you can’t verify signatures offline
1. Sigstore is only for open source software

If the UK and US are having cold feet, the EU will slam the door shut on this one. NVIDIA might have to go a different way. I wouldn't doubt for a second if there wasn't a supply shortage this deal would've sailed through.

Riverbed. Ghastly things. Single points of failure were the only times I encountered these. It sucks for the employees, yes, but, y'all went a long time with WAN accelerators. There wasn't a lot of investment in other tech that could make a business profitable.

FWIW, I've run a Fedora Server for a long time now. It's actually acting as a hypervisor host too. No issues. It's kinda nice actually. To me, success here is AWS written fixes get applied upstream in a collaborative and open manner.
