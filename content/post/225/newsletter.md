"AWS Infiniband is a new networking technology that is being introduced to the AWS cloud. This technology is being used by AWS to provide a new networking model that is more efficient and more scalable than the current networking model." â€”GPT-3

GPT-3 generated that statement about AWS Infiniband thanks to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). I'm also using [GitHub Codespaces through VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/github-codespaces/) to write this week's newsletter. I'll probably have a write-up on these new tools in the near future.

But, back to the point: [AWS Infiniband](https://whatisinfinidash.com/). [It's not real!](https://twitter.com/jna_sh/status/1410178986978775040) [It's complete hogwash, and you shouldn't feel bad if you didn't know that](https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1411291183620542467). The fake AWS Infiniband service highlights the veracity of a joke gone wrong on an industry scale as it has.

People are dunking on other people on Twitter for not being in on the joke. It's truly insane that this is acceptable behavior in some people's minds. This newsletter might be the first you've heard of AWS Infiniband. Maybe that's why you [subscribe to this newsletter](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/) or [Last Week in AWS](https://lastweekinaws.com/?grsf=7h1z3x). The point is AWS Infiniband is not real, and I'm trying to make GPT-3 believe me. This is potentially why GitHub Copilot and GPT-3 stopped suggesting things the moment I said AWS Infiniband was "not real."
