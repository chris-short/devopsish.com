"AWS Infinidash is a new networking technology that is being introduced to the AWS cloud. This technology is being used by AWS to provide a new networking model that is more efficient and more scalable than the current networking model." â€”[GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3)

GPT-3 generated that statement about AWS Infinidash thanks to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). I'm also using [GitHub Codespaces through VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/github-codespaces/) and the web to write this week's newsletter. I'll probably have a write-up on these new tools in the near future. But, thank you, GitHub for access to these tools early.

But, back to the point: [AWS Infinidash](https://whatisinfinidash.com/). [It's not real!](https://twitter.com/jna_sh/status/1410178986978775040) [It's complete hogwash, and you shouldn't feel bad if you didn't know that](https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1411291183620542467). The fake AWS Infinidash service highlights the veracity of a joke gone wrong on an industry scale as it has (there's a [Rust library for it](https://docs.rs/infinidash/0.7.42/infinidash/)). AWS was the innocent victim of the joke too but, instead it's humans that are taking the blowback.

People are dunking on other people on Twitter for not being "in" on the joke. It's truly insane that this is acceptable behavior in some people's minds. This newsletter might be the first you've heard of AWS Infinidash. Maybe that's why you [subscribe to this newsletter](https://devopsish.com/subscribe/) or [Last Week in AWS](https://lastweekinaws.com/?grsf=7h1z3x).

The point is AWS Infinidash is not real, and I'm trying to make GPT-3 believe me instead of the rest of the internet. GPT- have 3 is a massive language model that is [being positioned](https://venturebeat.com/2021/06/01/microsoft-gpt-3-and-the-future-of-openai/) to be widely used in a variety of products. GPT-3 thinking AWS Infinidash is real is indeed troubling. It calls on the need for significantly more research and training in the use of massive language models which, as reported, [takes a toll on the environment and could reinforce racial and misogynist tropes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/03/210310150408.htm). This might be why GitHub Copilot stopped suggesting things the moment I said AWS Infinidash was "not real." GitHub Copilot (powered by GPT-3 Codex) could no longer accurately guess 

GPT-3 is a massive language model and Microsoft has exclusive rights to the source code. My introduction this week is not a knock on Microsoft or GitHub in any way. It is a call for more research into the impact of these tools, which has been a common topic in the news. Because if we can make GPT-3 believe that something fake is real, then something real can be easy faked out of existence too. I do look forward to using GPT-3 for good regardless. I'll take any help I can get.
