I used to think of industry analysts as 100% worthless to the broader technology world. After meeting [Chris Gardner](https://www.forrester.com/Chris-Gardner) from Forrester, some of the good folks from [RedMonk](https://redmonk.com/), and working with Red Hat's Analyst Relations team, I've warmed up to Analysts a little. They serve an important function that a lot of us forget: [***Tactical efficiency does not replace strategic efficacy***](https://chrisshort.net/tactical-efficiency-does-not-replace-strategic-efficacy/)...

[DevOps vs. middle managers: 5 tips to knock out resistance](https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2019/9/devops-vs-middle-managers) — "DevOps teams encounter all types of doubters, but middle managers can be especially hard to get on board."

More follow up on the [Seth Vargo—Chef](https://chrisshort.net/seth-vargo-says-hell-noputs-chef-on-ice/) story:

* ['Everyone Should Have a Moral Code' Says Developer Who Deleted Code Sold to ICE](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbm3xn/chef-sugar-author-deletes-code-sold-to-ice-immigration-customs-enforcement) (VICE)

* [An Update to the Chef Community Regarding Current Events](https://blog.chef.io/an-update-to-the-chef-community-regarding-current-events/) (Chef)

[Open source developers: Stop blocking organizations you don't like](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/open-source-developers-stop-blocking-organizations-you-dont-like/) — Wow! Matt Asay really crossed over to the dark side quick! You see, [Matt Asay works for Amazon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mjasay/) which has an awful track record respecting open source. To compound matters, Matt didn't even bother to register this fact with readers. This is gross on Asay's and AWS' part.

[What are your red flags for job hunting (/r/devops)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/d8onnc/what_are_your_red_flags_for_job_hunting/) — This is a good thread on things to look out for when considering new career opportunities.

[Confused why Trump fingered CrowdStrike in that Ukraine call? You're not the only one...](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/09/25/crowdstrike_mention_in_ukraine/) — Apparently there's a "missing server" myth floating around. I say myth because the FBI contradicts that narrative. CrowdStrike imaged all evidence and worked with those images. Not the actual pieces of hardware. This is wild, y'all.

## Process

[Clean code... Why bother?](https://dev.to/paulasantamaria/clean-code-why-bother-21lo) — "Why I believe clean code is important and worth your time!" The extra little bit helps. But, for many an enterprise, solving 80% of the problem is good enough. There's a balance here but, it needs to tilt towards folks reading the code.

[Chef is Dead (/r/devops)](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/d7lzp4/chef_is_dead/) — I did not write this (I swear). The author points out, "Chef took the #1 spot for Most Dreaded Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools in the [2019 Stack Overflow developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-other-frameworks-libraries-and-tools). That is damning by itself, and this data was aggregated before the [Chef—ICE debacle](https://chrisshort.net/seth-vargo-says-hell-noputs-chef-on-ice/). That will negatively impact the survey results the next time it runs. Chef's mishandling of the ICE issue has led me to state a long-held thought out loud. In my opinion, Chef died when they conducted layoffs a while back. A look back in the DevOps'ish archives indicates [Chef's death was publicly reported on November 14, 2018](https://devopsish.com/104/) (almost a year ago). Chef is now in a worse position than Docker.

[Docker is trying to raise money following arrival of CEO Rob Bearden](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/docker-is-trying-to-raise-money-following-arrival-of-ceo-rob-bearden.html) — Docker, Inc. is trying to raise money after being worth over a cool billion. The problem is, this is going to be a huge valuation down round. In one shareholder's opinion, "Docker is a tragic story of what could have been." If only someone saw this coming... [Docker has been dead a while](https://chrisshort.net/docker-inc-is-dead/). But, this round might really be the end for Docker. I don't see their strategy paying off. They don't have enough of a foothold in the market for it to catch on. This funding round is an admission of that. What will happen to Docker? All the core technology is open source (has been for a while). The company itself will likely be sold (for a fraction of its once lofty value) and be absorbed into a larger entity with significant investment in this space already. Splunk seems to be on a buying spree. Salesforce has loads of money too. Oracle or Microsoft are still contenders, in my opinion, but I doubt accountants from those firms will offer Docker their egos' worth of money. Hubris and toxicity kills. Here's [my disclaimer](https://devopsish.com/terms/) since Docker people try to get me fired when I write about them.

Yikes!
