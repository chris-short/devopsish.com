Some people understand that the advancement of technology is marching at an ever quickening pace. Weâ€™re talking about exponential advancement every year. Five years ago, [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) was brand new. Now it's democratizing computing across clouds. Docker, the company behind some glue technology that made containers the new norm in software, has [died twice now](https://www.tariqislam.com/posts/kubernetes-docker-dep/). The size and shape of infrastructure has changed so much in the past two years, it's hard to remember ten years ago when [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) was brand new.

I've been thinking about my typical end of year blog post this week quite a bit. Trying to accurately predict what next year will bring is difficult. When an organization offers to support something for ten years, it seems increasingly daunting to fathom what the technology landscape will look like.

When I found out (the same time you did) about [CentOS Stream](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/), I appreciated it ([FAQ](https://centos.org/distro-faq/)). It feels like DevOps has touched the enterprise operating system I was using when I first started learning DevOps. But, then I realized, like most decent digital transformations, change is often met with some resistance. The best people in DevOps are the ones that can [help people see the future a little clearer](https://youtu.be/MDu6wL1DWY4). Some people lean into DevOps; some people resist it. This is human nature.

There's nothing I'm going to say or do that's going to change anything. But, I hope you can seek out understanding as [Kristian KÃ¶hntopp](https://blog.koehntopp.info/2020/12/09/embracing-the-stream.html) did. It might not be the popular thing, but it helps when you realize the [sea change that has occurred underneath us all](https://www.cncf.io/).

The rapid adoption of Kubernetes to manage containerized workloads is driving great efficiencies in application development, deployment, and scalability. However, when security becomes an afterthought, you risk diminishing the greatest gain of containerization - agility. [Download this ebook](https://security.stackrox.com/kubernetes-security-ebook-tips-tricks-best-practices.html?Source=DevOpsIsh&LSource=DevOpsIsh) to learn how to (1) build secure images and prevent untrusted/vulnerable code, (2) configure RBAC, network policies, and runtime privileges, (3) detect unauthorized runtime activity, and (4) secure your Kubernetes infrastructure components such as the API server. *SPONSORED*

"The more database-intensive query (getting all payment records for the previous week) took nearly as long as the interval to return results, and very soon was taking longer than the interval. Even though the Prometheus scrape was timing out after 10 seconds, the query was still running to completion on the database. After around 15 minutes we were in a situation where the database was overloaded by this query running multiple times, so much so that other services which use this database (such as login) were unable to interact with it."
