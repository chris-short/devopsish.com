+++

Towards the end of my workday on Tuesday, [tragedy struck the YouTube HQ in San Bruno, CA](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/livid-over-sites-policies-youtube-shooter-trained-for-attack-shot-randomly/). A shooter made their way through a parking deck to a patio where people were eating and socializing. The shooter opened fire claiming three victims before turning the weapon on themselves. In Google's [Project Aristotle](https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/), psychological safety is identified as the number one contributor to "What makes a team effective at Google?" In the wake of this random act of violence, [Google's response](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/04/scope-of-youtube-shooters-plan-probed-as-shaken-staffers-recover/) might be the most watched handling of a workplace shooting. This is not the postmortem we want. But, this could be the postmortem we need.

Intel is not worth the money. Apple is doing innovative work on ARM chips. The fact my iPhone has six cores and my first generation iPad Pro can run Civilization VI with no fans is impressive.
