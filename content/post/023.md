I have to admit, I am really, really angry this week. For the first time in a long time a worm was unleashed on the web. A little back story. Years ago, the NSA found a vulnerability in Windows. Instead of disclosing the vulnerability responsibility to Microsoft, the NSA decided to keep the vulnerability a secret. Years pass and NSA is happily using this zero-day to exploit the United States' various enemies. Then, one day, several exploits are found on a server somewhere by [The Shadow Brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers?ref=devopsish). The Shadow Brokers then released the exploits they discovered.

Fast forward to this week and [the WannaCry exploit](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-132A?ref=devopsish) is unleashed on the web. [The UK's NHS was the first major victim](https://www.theguardian.com/society/live/2017/may/12/england-hospitals-cyber-attack-nhs-live-updates?ref=devopsish). Rapidly the [WannaCry tidal wave was washing over 99 countries](http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/12/technology/ransomware-attack-nsa-microsoft/index.html?ref=devopsish). Meanwhile, back in the UK, [a researcher discovers that there is a kill switch in the exploit](https://www.malwaretech.com/2017/05/how-to-accidentally-stop-a-global-cyber-attacks.html). Apparently, the NSA put a kill switch is in place in case the worm accidentally went public (WHICH IT DID). The kill switch, was a check to see if a specific domain existed; not responding with a 200, not having a specific payload or string, nothing! Just whether or not a domain was REGISTERED controlled the worm! The NSA didn't think to spend the $11 to kill the worm. But, a 22-year-old in the UK saved billions of dollars and probably lives with $11 while *the NSA maintained its horrific negligence*. Unconscionable!

Did everyone have a conference this week?!? OSCON, OpenStack Summit Boston, Microsoft Build, and Dell EMC World all took place this week. I saw the most activity around OSCON on Twitter. Surprisingly, Microsoft Build kept popping up in my Twitter stream frequently. As far as buzz, OSCON won the week though. [Highlights from OSCON are available](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/highlights-from-oscon-austin-2017?ref=devopsish).

I spent WAY more than ten minutes on it.
