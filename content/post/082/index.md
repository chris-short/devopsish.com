Twelve hours after this newsletter was published last week, I was on a plane back to my old stomping grounds in Raleigh, North Carolina. [I started at Red Hat this week on the Ansible team as Principal Product Marketing Manager](https://chrisshort.net/joining-ansible-team-at-red-hat/). After the first week, I feel like this is the best career move I've ever made. It's also a move that I've wanted to make for a long time. But, the delay has been well worth it. I look forward to working with teams internal and external to Red Hat to make Ansible an even better product than it already is.

As an aside, the family and I escaped the near triple-digit (Fahrenheit) temperatures of the Greater Detroit Metro for way "up north" Michigan. The image this week is of my son Max playing on the beach of Lake Michigan in [Petosky State Park](https://www.michigan.org/property/petoskey-state-park). Get out and enjoy the world around you when you have some time. Also, if you're disabled in any way be sure to take care of yourself.
